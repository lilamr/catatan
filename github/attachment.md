You can convey information by attaching a variety of file types to your issues and pull requests.

**Note:** For public repositories, uploaded files can be accessed without authentication. In the case of private and internal repositories, only people with access to the repository can view the uploaded files.

To attach a file to an issue or pull request conversation, drag and drop it into the comment box. Alternatively, you can click

in the formatting bar above the comment box to browse, select, and add a file from your computer.

When you attach a file, it is uploaded immediately to GitHub and the text field is updated to show the anonymized URL for the file. For more information on anonymized URLs see "[About anonymized URLs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-anonymized-urls)".

**Note:** In many browsers, you can copy-and-paste images directly into the box.

The maximum file size is:

- 10MB for images and gifs
- 10MB for videos uploaded to a repository owned by a user or organization on a free GitHub plan
- 100MB for videos uploaded to a repository owned by a user or organization on a paid GitHub plan
- 25MB for all other files

**Note:** To upload videos greater than 10MB to a repository owned by a user or organization on a paid GitHub plan, you must either be an organization member or outside collaborator, or be on a paid plan.

We support these files:

- PNG (_.png_)
- GIF (_.gif_)
- JPEG (_.jpg_, _.jpeg_)
- SVG (_.svg_)
- Log files (_.log_)
- Markdown files (_.md_)
- Microsoft Word (_.docx_), Powerpoint (_.pptx_), and Excel (_.xlsx_) documents
- Text files (_.txt_)
- PDFs (_.pdf_)
- ZIP (_.zip_, _.gz_, _.tgz_)
- Video (_.mp4_, _.mov_, _.webm_)

**Note:** Video codec compatibility is browser specific, and it's possible that a video you upload to one browser is not viewable on another browser. At the moment we recommend using h.264 for greatest compatibility.
