One of the main goals of a Source Control Management system is to allow for multiple developers to collaborate efficiently. That often means they can't afford to wait their turn to make changes to files. However, as you may recall, one of the highlighted features of Git is that the entire history is held locallyâ€”right there on your machine.

So, how can multiple people collaborate, making changes to the same files, when they all have their own copies of those files? Without the special help provided by Git through merging it'd be impossible. Sadly, exploring the detail of a merge is beyond the scope of this short introduction, but you can find more information at the Atlassian Git Tutorial (http://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorial/git-branches#!merge) and the Git Reference (http://gitref.org/branching/).
