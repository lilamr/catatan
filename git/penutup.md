So now you knowâ€”when your projects are under Source Control with Git, the next time you find yourself cursing a seemingly irrevocable change, all is not lost.

There are even ways to undo changes that have not yet been committed! That functionality is beyond the scope of this guide, but a search on Google or Bing will yield plenty of detailed explanations.

One final important thing to note is that in the simple example we walked through here, we primarily used a single text file: TheFirstFile.txt. That was purely for illustration, but the same process can be applied to any file on your computer!

Hopefully we've covered enough here for you to have a good, basic understanding of what Git can do and why it can be so very useful when undertaking any substantial project.
