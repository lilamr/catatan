“An important part of coding is learning how to organize data.” (Lyman, p. 27)
“In code, you would do this with an object. An object is a bunch of pieces of data all organized together. We can also call this an associative array, a dictionary, or a map.” (Lyman, p. 28)
“Really all we’ve done is declare four variables” (Lyman, p. 28)
“And instead of calling them “variables,” we call them “properties” or “fields.” An object can have any properties you want” (Lyman, p. 28)
