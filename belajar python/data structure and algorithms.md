“models allow us to describe the data that our algorithms will manipulate in a much more consistent way with respect to the problem itself.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)

“The implementation of an abstract data type, often referred to as a data structure, will require that we provide a physical view of the data using some collection of programming constructs and primitive data types.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6) 
Artinya, meskipun **ADT** didefinisikan secara abstrak berdasarkan operasi yang dapat dilakukan padanya, kita tetap perlu mengimplementasikannya secara nyata menggunakan fitur-fitur pemrograman seperti array, linked list, atau tipe data dasar seperti integer dan string.

“One algorithm may use many fewer resources than another. One algorithm might take 10 times as long to return the result as the other.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 7)
“In the end, there are often many ways to solve a problem. Finding a solution and then deciding whether it is a good one are tasks that we will do over and over again.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 8)
