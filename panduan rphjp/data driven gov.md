a truly data-driven public sector:  
- recognises data as a key strategic asset with its value defined and its impact measured  
- reflects active efforts to remove barriers to managing, sharing and re-using data  
- applies data to transform the design, delivery and monitoring of public policies and services  
- values efforts to publish data openly as much as the use of data between, and within, public sector organisations.  
  
apply data to generate public value through three types of activity:  
- Anticipation and planning: using data in the design of policies, planning of interventions, anticipation of possible change and the forecasting of needs  
- Delivery: using data to inform and improve policy implementation, the responsiveness of governments and the activity of providing public services  
- Evaluation and monitoring: the use of data in measuring impact, auditing decisions and monitoring performance  
  
Data-driven public sector: The importance of data as a foundational enabler for public sector organisations to work together in forecasting needs, shaping delivery, and understanding and responding to change.  
  
Government as a platform: Building an ecosystem to support and equip public servants to make policy and deliver services that encourages government to collaborate with citizens, businesses, civil society and others.  
  
Many aspects of public sector delivery are based on hypotheses about the efficacy of government interventions; data allow governments to test and adjust their approaches. In the field of regulation, to cite one example, the ability to carry out real-time analysis based on various sources of data provides a transformative opportunity to rethink from the ground up the way in which a particular aspect of the public sector might function, thus moving away from a one-size-fits-all model to responding to demand, risk and context.  
  
The first phase is “anticipation and planning”, with its understanding of the role of data in designing policy, anticipating change, forecasting need and imaging future possibilities. This phase focuses on how data can be used to look ahead, whether to anticipate a multiplicity of potential futures or in preparing to take action to resolve a particular problem. “Anticipation and planning” relies on a variety of sources for the data to carry out these activities, including those generated through the evaluation of previous and ongoing interventions.  
  
The second phase, “delivery”, and the activities associated with implementation of policies.  
  
The Third, “evaluation and monitoring” in terms of measuring impact, auditing decisions and monitoring performance, is focused on retrospectively analysing events that have taken place and drawing insights from the data generated through the “delivery” phase. these phases should be seen as a continuum, where the application of data in the “anticipation and planning” phase may lead to a set of deliverables, during the “delivery” of which new data will be generated and insights applied and which subsequently will provide the data for the “evaluation and monitoring” of performance and impact.  
  
Assuming that such data have been sourced, the “anticipation and planning” phase can begin to see data applied to define and plan an intervention, provide the evidence to support policy-making activity, and the anticipatory governance pursuits of foresight and forecasting.  
  
When data were used to provide an anticipatory position, it was mostly as a reaction to some existing data or activities with a view to creating a new, forward-looking perspective.  
  
Anticipatory governance describes systematic efforts to consider the future in order to inform policy decisions today. In this context, governments respond proactively rather than reactively, based on knowledge and evidence rather than experience and protocol.  
  
The use of data leads to the better detection of societal needs as they emerge and improves predictions for future needs.  
  
Data-enabled prediction and modelling techniques support governments in anticipating societal, economic or natural developments that are likely to occur in the future. They may also capture early warnings and better assess the need to intervene. Additionally, governments that are built on strong data foundations are able to deliver proactive government services that anticipate the needs of citizens.  
  
Anticipatory governance falls into two categories: forecasting and foresight.  
  
Forecasting in the DDPS context is to use existing data and trends to try to predict the most likely developments and outcomes.  
  
Forecasting capabilities attempt to spot emerging needs, and anticipate new ones, based on observable trends, be they physical or digital,  
  
Foresight is associated with horizon scanning in order to define problems; it does not attempt to predict the future. It is instead a systematic approach to explore multiple plausible versions of how the future could be different from expected and use those insights to shape policies in ways that can be more agile in responding to them. The most relevant data for foresight processes are those that might identify emerging changes in the present, which could grow into significant and disruptive developments in the future.  
  
Foresight mindset requires a commitment to a longer term outlook rather than the short-term political cycles that can sometimes cause policies to focus on immediate issues or demands rather than longer term planning.  
  
Using the foresight method means that the team takes data from the past and extrapolates it into the future using a variety of tools, from statistics to simulations.  
  
The application of data can reshape the opportunities for designing better policy interventions and services through a deeper and more rounded understanding of the needs of citizens  
  
In order to generate the maximum public value, it is essential to clearly define the purpose of its application; but this is only half the exercise. The other half is identifying how to measure the value and judge the success, or otherwise, of a given intervention.  
  
Move away from a top-down design and implementation of public services to the formulation of well-targeted service design and need-based policy implementation and service delivery, thereby increasing the reach and effectiveness of services.  
  
Ensure government resources have been effectively managed, those motivated by a desire to understand the impact of the intervention  
  
The insights generated from evaluating policy are critical for iterating and developing new policy approaches  
  
Increasing the amount of data associated with the outcome of a given policy allows for agile policy adjustments in the short term, but more importantly will generate better insights into the policy process in terms of accountability and learning in the mid- to long term. Those responsible for a given policy can establish whether their policies have had the desired effect or not and, if those data are published as OGD, so can other stakeholders. As a result, policy evaluation can turn into an open, inclusive and ongoing process rather than an internal, snapshot moment.  
  
Support arguments for funding and measurement of the impact of that spend.  
  
Measuring the impact of a given set of activities requires setting a baseline and developing a methodology to understand costs and benefits. These need to be considered when a public sector organisation is deciding to invest money in tackling a problem or designing a policy intervention during the “anticipation and planning” stage.  
  
Without such baselines, it is difficult for institutions to measure the efficacy of control activities. As a result, assessment of the effectiveness of prevention and detection activities are often anecdotal.
