editors are TEXMAKER

In 2016, I first used LaTeX Editor to do complete my project work. And since then, I have been using TEXMAKER and TeXstudio. After joining PhD, I came to know about Overleaf. A few months back, I know about Kile, which is made for Windows, from the Microsoft Store

that you can download.

Speaking of my choice, I like TeXstudio, TEXMAKER, Overleaf all the three LATEX

editors. Whenever it is required, I frequently use anyone of them.

Kile - I haven't tried too much. However, the same TEX file from TeXstudio or TEXMAKER should run in Kile. In my case, I tried few times, it worked properly.

- If you would like to ask me about the most user-friendly LATEX

editor and then I'll mention the online LATEX- editor - Overleaf.

- You must have to create an account to use Overleaf. [From this link](https://www.overleaf.com/?r=0e52b224&rm=d&rs=b "www.overleaf.com"), you can create and use your account.

- As It works online, you can access anywhere, whenever you want.
- To get started as an apprentice, you can begin to with Overleaf as it corrects minor mistakes by itself.

- The minor difficulties of overleaf are that

- You always need to have an internet connection, and
- sometimes, your Overleaf compiled TEX file may not work correctly on TeXstudio or TEXMAKER.

- Whereas, the TeXstudio or TEXMAKER is the simplest and most common version of LATEX editor.

- If you can compile a TEX file in TeXstudio or TEXMAKER properly, perhaps, you can run that TEX file anywhere in the world in any LATEX

- editor.
- If you have a general understanding of programming/coding, it will be useful to use it.
