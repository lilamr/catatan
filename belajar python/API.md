“Nobody starts from scratch. We’re all constantly using code we didn’t write—buckets of it, in fact. Even if you are a prolific coder and write millions of lines of code in your lifetime, you will use far more lines of code that someone else wrote. Most of this code will come from complete strangers.” (Lyman, p. 32)

“How do you use this zombie code? Copy and paste? Occasionally, yes, but not often. Most of the time you’ll access it through an Application Programming Interface or API. An API is a bundled-up set of properties and methods (purpose-built pieces of code) that are named, like variables, so you can refer to them by their name and let them do their thing.” (Lyman, p. 32)

“A method is like a property because you access it with a dot. A method is different from a property because you have to put ( parentheses ) after it. These parentheses are holding the data we want to add” (Lyman, p. 33)

“Building a working vocabulary in this API is an essential part of becoming a web developer.” (Lyman, p. 33)
