00:00:08	yeah welcome yeah we like to we've been trying to post things you know from meetings and it's very difficult get into the video but it's easy to relatively easy to record audio along with the Powerpoints and that's what Camtasia does so be watching and you'd hear the voice and you'd hear exactly see what you're seeing right here so the goal here this morning is to talk about Forest ecology and management principles I like to call this forensic forestry because for those of us on the walk it's kind of this idea of reading the land

00:00:36	looking what's there and trying to figure out how what is there came about you know by looking at the evidence that presents itself and one thing I hope that you'll get out of this talk and as you go through the the weekend is that idea of this becoming opening your eyes a little bit to look at the woods in a different perspective than you did before seeing some of those Clues and you know maybe it's is a little too touchy feely but you know where do we start you know think about the plants that are out there you know think like a

00:01:04	plant act like a plant I don't try to stick my feet in the ground but the point is if we have we all have some favorite plants who here has a favorite tree or plant has to be a tree or shrub but in the forest what would that be okay so that's horn beam right iron wood okay I'm not sure many people know what iron wood is but when you think about a tree like that where would you where does it grow okay so again you think about these different types of trees some trees are a little more ubiquitous they grow in a

00:01:38	range of different ranges but a lot of plants have certain conditions certain site conditions we're kind of call it that they have requirement for with regards to moisture and and those types of things that and that's where you're going to find them and we talked our table a little bit about Tree ID and that's a real key for tree identification is that certain trees have certain requirements and if you're in these areas then you know that they they may be there but if you're in other areas you know like we looked at yellow

00:02:04	popper you know if I'm up on some rocky Ridgetop I'm not going to find yellow poer trees they're just not going to be there now we're going to find Chestnut Oak and other things maybe Virginia pine or things like that so with regards to plants what does a plant really need it needs three things it needs light it needs water it needs nutrients and by far probably the most important thing is light light is what really rules the roost and drives a lot of the dynamic that happens in the forest because if

00:02:31	you think about it if I have a piece of land here okay and these are the three requirements the trees have you know within that area more than likely the water and the nutrients are going to be fairly similar that are on that piece of land right the only variable really is light and that's what most of the most of the plant response what most plants respond to is differences in light and we'll learn that you know some trees are more tolerant are intolerant in other words they need um full sunlight to grow other ones are

00:03:04	tolerant of shade they can grow in the shade and in this battle have to think about the forest as a dynamic kind of entity that's continually changing these trees kind of many fighting it out to get up into the canopy especially in the earlier stages of the forest development okay and the ones that win out are the ones that are big trees but there are other trees that are more tolerant and don't need full sunlight and they can kind of come up underneath those are the ones that come in later we talked about Beach know

00:03:37	sugar maple Hemlock those are trees that can kind of grow up in the shade a lot of the trees that we really rely on for a lot of benefits for for forest and Wildlife um tend to be more intolerant they need full sunlight they're not going to grow and succeed unless they have full sunlight and we can talk a little bit about that later so these are a couple things we're not going to get probably down to this but these are a couple things I just want to talk about and get you thinking a little bit about

00:04:04	all right this is kind of a prepper course and this it's this whole idea of site that I just mentioned and site is kind of that environment it supports a forest or a woodland and it influences the trees and plants growing there so the site is the sum total of all those things that are acting it's also it's a soil it's the topography in other words this is a a top of a slope it's the bottom of a slope that's important the climate you know the climate in gar county is different than the climate in

00:04:30	the Eastern Shore and that's going to affect the site quality you know the that ability of that place to grow vegetation and trees and shrubs and then of course we have the whole issue with plants and animals all right so we're going to use that word a lot we use it a lot in forestry it's a it has a it's a good site it's a good growing site typically what that means it's fairly fertile growing site good moisture and good soils and things like that so we use this word a lot and that's where we're going to kind of follow through on

00:04:59	some of of that and we're going to talk about succession does everybody know what farest succession is pretty much it's that basically that predictable change in plan communities now you remember last night I said this is a word that most people don't know you talk about succession of people can you think of another word they might understand life cycle okay yeah we a lot of times we're using the term young Forest we have a young Forest you know instead of a a successional Forest you know early

00:05:31	successional Forest of it's young trees talk about a young forest or young Forest development basically it's the same thing you know it's that transition from an old field for example into a forest and the stages and and the things that they place and what what what'll take place will depend on the site in other words is it a is it a fertile growing site you know is it the top of a hill that site quality is going to affect those changes in community and one thing is Foresters you learn and with helping people make decision

00:06:01	management decisions is understanding how you know a site affects what's going to happen to the trees every there if any type of if nothing is done or even if some type of management activity is done now this is really important sight's more important than the vegetation that's on it this has never been trer than you think about what's been happened with invasive species right I can go most people here know what tree of Heaven is alanthus okay that's a good example it takes over doesn't it okay now if I have a a a

00:06:35	piece of property and it's all tree of Heaven does that mean that's a terrible growing site or it's really the result of of what of the past activity that's taken place there typically the past land use and that's the case with a lot of your Properties or any property like we pointed out this morning that really what's there depends on what has happened in the past was it past Ed was it harvested and it's it's um with the site quality itself you know the amount the moisture and the soils that's pretty

00:07:07	fixed and it's very stable what's growing there as a result of past land use and that's what the value of doing uh Forest activity and management activity is that you can make that change that site quality is still there but you can change the vegetation that's grow there by different types of actions um okay let's look at site from a kind of a overview or a macro point of view and in Maryland you know like many places on the East Coast we have a lot of different physiographic regions which are basically regions with different

00:07:39	climate and different types of topography you know we have the we have the Western Maryland up on the alany plateau which is basically gar County high elevation you know cold you know Winters certain types of trees grow there we have the ren Valley uh by Cumberland and we're in this Great Valley uh where hagertown is which is pretty much all Limestone what called cars topography you know a lot of erosions taking place and very rich soils but all Heavy clay soils but very good for farming and then the pedmont

00:08:12	region which where a lot of your um tobacco you know used to take place and some of these soils have lost a lot of their their top soils due the past agricultural practices and the coastal plane which is typically very Sandy you know very water table is very close to the surface so these are Broad regions this is this this is some pictures to show it again gar County you're going to find what we call Northern Hardwoods there like red red uh black cherry you know Red Oak uh sugar maple things like

00:08:43	that okay you're going to find Laval Pine going to G car County because G because laa Pine cannot grow where there's heavy Winters and ice and snow it basically would just it just doesn't make it okay and then we move down into the into the alag the r Valley these are are very poor soils typically very Shaley very thin and it's kind of a rain shadow too I don't if you ever realized that but um basically all our weather comes from the west and what happens is up on the alag plateau is where all you

00:09:14	get all your moisture and as air masses drop they basically suck up moisture they don't they don't release it so when you get through the rigon valley basically these are very dry a rainfall drops down to a I don't know maybe 20 30 inches of rainy a up here it's you know probably 50 or 60 45 to 60 and then it starts to regenerate as you get back here and you get to the influence of the Chesapeake and Eastern Seaboard alag County properties are very in terms of forest and stuff they're very dry very poor

00:09:45	soils and things like that there not a lot of moisture so and then we get down into the pedmont region which is basically the pomac river and uh never mentioned this but you know this a lot of the farming that took place here in the coastal plane a lot of these plates have lost a lot of their top soil and um is anybody driven through the pedmont region especially down at Virginia in the spring and you see all the soils are really red ever noticed that that's because you're looking at subsoil most of that most of that top

00:10:14	soil was was lost since the early colonization it was produced a lot of tobacco and the soils were not covered or you know there was no winter cover or anything like that and the way it would work is that the plow would go down 12 inches grow a crop on it come winter time you get a lot of some maybe a little bit of erosion off the top next spring dig down another 12 in and what you do over the course of 00 years is basically you eat away at most of your top soil and most of that ends up in ches PE

00:10:47	Bay um and then we get down to the coastal plain of Southern Maryland with a lot of L lot of Pine Forest and then on the Eastern Shore as well where um you have a very you know very shallow soils high water tables should I turn this light out would that make it easier I think uh that better yeah so and this is uh you know typical soil profile so uh we're not going to get a lot into soils here except the how do soils form idea erosion okay you can have soils where you have aluvial soils where actually you know things erode from

00:11:31	other places and deposit like in a flood plane and stuff like that but how about if you have an intact site how do the soils develop yeah so actually decompos from the bottom up over time you get this leeching of water down through here it gets into this bedrock and and basically starts to break some of that apart and over time soils get deeper and deeper it's actually weather from the bottom up you know people don't really realize that so that's why it's real important and we lose top soil we're actually

00:12:02	losing that top soil which has taken the Millennia to to form so um and this is what I talked about with the uh earlier European colonization we grew a lot of tobacco as a cash crop and these soils were heavily farmed and again what happened is like I just said with the plow you go down there was no winter cover you get winter weather some erosion next spring you dig down another 12 inches and you end up with um you know some erosion and in Forest practices we use what are called best management practices because it's really

00:12:38	important to protect that upper soil layer because most of the roots of a tree are within the top 12 inches or so of of the soil so we want to protect that so you know when you use heavy equipment you have to make sure the roads are laid out properly that you control the water movement and we'll see some of that this afternoon in Mr goran's property where he has a very a lot of topography in you have to make sure that you direct the water off every once in a while so it doesn't build up speed and cause erosion and if you go

00:13:06	dig down into a lot of the soils around here you can find What's called the plow layer if you're not sure if your farm has been you know area has been uh uh cropped you can actually dig down and you'll see this about 12 inches down this distinct layer where it goes from a dark to a much lighter soil and that's basically where the tip of the plow hit kind you see that a lot a lot of lands around here if you don't see that probably probably area that was pastured so how about tree tree height on how well trees grow um soil texture

00:13:40	what do you think grows the best soil grows the best trees a very sandy soil a heavy clay or what would be kind of a nice mix of clay Loom we're all a lot of gardeners here right so it' be be the one in the middle right so ideally those are usually the best grow soils and um you know there's a lot of exceptions to all this but you have certain trees that are adapted to what we call Wetland soils like can you think of a tree that Cypress is a great example okay you know even things like L blowy Pine can grow in Fairly you know

00:14:11	very wet areas silver maple red maple there's certain trees that are very well adapted to grow in Wetland soils and others that aren't um and that's real important if you get into tree planting a lot of tree planting going on these days and it's really important if you're going to plant trees to match the tree to the site so this is a very wet area right here okay and these are black walnut trees now I know again we're kind of educating here but our black walnut a type of tree that likes to grow and get it root get

00:14:45	its uh Roots wet grow in a wetland soil now black walnut is one of those trees again it likes real fertile soils kind of like black yellow popper but it doesn't like standing water likes well drains soils so what was planted here was a lot of of black walnut but basically most of them have died because there's just a PA very poor choice to plant on a very wet soil like that so you know really comes there's a lot of tree planting going these days and it's very important the tree planning to be successful to make sure that it matches

00:15:17	the site that's there is that a real wet site they have uh you know standing water throughout the year and there's ways you can you can figure that out who here has ever looked at a soils map or here does not knows what a soil map is you've heard that term before okay soil is basically the uh the basic aspect of you know productive capacity of the land you know what's in the soil is it fertile is it wet is it deep and there's been a lot of effort put in over the years to determine that now there's

00:15:50	always this idea that people have the idea this tree has this huge tap route that goes down 20 30 feet you know it ain't so okay uh that's my daughter now who's working in Wyoming but um so this is an old picture but it kind of gets across the point that when you see trees that are overturned you see that most of the roots of the tree are within that 10 to 15 inches of top soil that's again when we look those forestry practices it's very important not to to disturb that upper root mat or to minimize the impact

00:16:23	on it which can be done through proper harvesting techniques so and what we have at our what I would encourage you to do for property that you may work on or that you may um own would be to get a soils map this is all online now we used to have to all this through the had a written soil survey for each County you get this book and they have a black and white photograph and you know you're kind of trying to figure out and of course the photos were from the 50s you know so half the stuff that is there is not there now and it

00:16:56	has little symbols next to it that tells you all this information about the soils and this is where we are right now in Shephard spring you're right here and you can see what they have done there a lot of efforts gone into this over the last uh you know 50 years to going out in the field and actually taking soil cores and you know every so so often and breaking up the land into these different soil types that have different characteristics and they usually based they have a name fine Sandy LOM uh they

00:17:27	usually have what percent slopes you tend to find there and there's a lot more description about these soils it'll tell you everything from how good it is for septic how good it is for sand and gravel and then it has some also information on um forest forest trees that tend to to grow on those types of soils and there's a lot of information online now and uh this is all digital and if you just go to web if you just Google web soil survey you'll it'll come up on Google and it'll just take you through and you

00:17:58	you can it'll bring up a map and you can draw a line around your property and it'll draw this map for you and it'll tell you the soils that are there and then you if you click on these you can find out all kinds of information about the soils on your property are those Wetland soils yeah probably yeah no not from here yeah the state of Maryland has a lot of information that's downloadable on um and there's another website they have called MD Merlin right do net MD merlin.net I don't have that up here but that's another great website

00:18:49	what they've done is taken all a lot of these databases in Maryland with soils and um threatened endangered species uh critical areas everything all these overlays and you can kind of turn them on or off and you can do the same type of thing you can identify an area and you can draw a map and it will show you all those issues that may those factors may affect that piece of land it's it's pretty powerful program they've improved it immensely so you may want to check that out MD merlin.net like the magician exactly it's all

00:19:25	magic so but again soils are the main State you know that's the productive capacity okay we have the climate all these factors are basically wrapped around that soil and that's why it's so important that we in what's happening in agriculture is to control you know runoff in the winter and everything because you want to keep that stuff on site we don't want to have the large top soil losses that we had you know back in the 18 1900s yeah yeah yeah this produces nice PDFs that's what this produces good point so check it out um I

00:20:07	don't think you get much into nutrient cycling except that there is a lot of it that takes place and typically it's a lot faster in hardwood systems because hardwood trees the leaves break down a lot faster than they do in Pines you go into a Pine Forest you'll find pine needles that have been there for you know the last five 10 years right you go down a little bit this are very acidic they don't break down as fast it's a little slower cycling most hardwood leaves you know they fall to the ground

00:20:30	man you know they're gone next year Oaks are probably a little more resistant some of them so that's an important aspect and like I said best management practices in forestry relate to trying to protect this root put in roads typically after they're done they're they're uh they direct the water off or they're replanted with some type of grass or uh and that's where the opportunity also puts some Wildlife uh plants in there as well so let's talk about slope position are the trees larger on the upper or the lower

00:21:00	slope middle who says the middle huh which one upper okay okay now just think about our own experience over time what happens to everything gravity pulls everything down to the bottom and it's basically same here it's the B on the bottom okay and this is kind of a pictograph of that and this is exactly kind of what happens with topography that's why when you go on the top of a ridge they're very shallow soils because over time what's happened is those soils have kind of eroded down and moved down as well as

00:21:45	nutrients and moisture so typically your fertile sites are found at the bottom or the toes at the bottom of the slopes that's where the water gravitates to and of course the nutrients are carried through that as well and over time those soils have come down as well so typically they're deeper down through here and so your better growing sites uh you know are found usually at the bottoms of slopes and not at the top so what you're going to find on the top here are trees that are adapted to these

00:22:16	drier thinner soils and lot the trees around here those would be like at Western Mar would be like your Oaks like Chestnut Oak and things like that and then down at the bottom you're going to find these Tre that really require fertile soils you know like yellow popper Walnut stuff like that so just kind of keep that in your mind okay um and this is a kind of an example this is South Mountain and this is in the fall and you can see these Brown trees up on the top those are all your Oaks Oaks are well adapted

00:22:49	to high you know dry soils and they do very well they compete uh with other things and other things can't compete with them and then you get these yellow trees which are what those are your yellow popler you you open your eyes you'll see this as you go out across the mountains okay now it's a little harder to see on a flat but you can even see you get in southern Maryland same kind of thing you you know you can get down in those drainages and things like that you'll find a lot of those yellow popour trees and this is

00:23:18	actually right across from where we're going to be today at Bonner Morgans again yellow poer down the bottom this is in the springtime so the trees are stratifying and of course we have certain trees that adapt to special conditions this is down at a right these trees are I don't know 150 years old not how much is going to compete with them they they've adapted to that site and again then we get into things like Cypress which have very special uh site requirements and they do very well there um aspect aspect is real important

00:23:52	more in more mountainous areas with topography uh but it's the direction that slow is facing now why would that be important sunlight okay so let me ask you this it's about solar radiation okay let's say you have a slope what would the line look like okay this is being uh this is being solar radiation this is being the time of day okay what would a line look like for a south facing slope okay sun rises where e that's in the west okay so where would we get the the max amount of solar radiation for for for a hill if it's

00:24:32	facing which way would it face where it would get the maximum amount it' be South right pretty much pretty much doe South right because it get all the morning sun and then it would get all the afternoon sun this average across the day okay does that make sense now let's say if the if the slope is facing north would it look what what would the line look like it'd be the same it'd be the same shape right it just be less because it's basically on the other side of the mountain it's getting some solar

00:25:09	radiation and it's getting basically the same uh the same path over the course of the day but it's a lot lower intensity isn't it yeah where we are yeah yeah we're not talking about what's happened in Brazil or anything okay yeah yeah I got you does that make sense because the hills you're on the North facing north the sun comes up you get some you know Sun that's solar radiation but it's of low intensity because you're not the sun's not directly on you all right and let's look at the let's look

00:25:46	at the uh Facing East I I already clicked the button but here you get most of your solar radiation in the morning right and then it would Peter out in the afternoon so my point is uh I think would be that which which direction or which aspect the mountain is fa the hill is facing is going to determine how much sunlight is hitting on those hitting on that slope and that's going to affect what types of trees grow there because different trees have different needs all right so let me ask you this question

00:26:17	this is a south facing slope and this is this is exactly I was talking about this is south facing slope in the middle of the day you can see on the North facing slope it's getting it's it's pretty much shaded it's still getting a lot of solar radiation but not as much which one of these do you think would U probably have a higher be a higher quality growing site for trees South who says South okay so why is that sun okay who says North why yeah actually he's right because what happens with south facing slopes is

00:26:54	they get a lot more sunlight but what it does is it bakes all the moisture out of the soil so actually trees need need water okay and so they kind if you ever been on a south facing slope in the middle of the day it's hot you know it's real hot compared to a North facing slope where it's much more in the shade so actually the species that you're going to find growing there differ on around here you'd find more like your Oaks over here and on the North facing slope is where you would find things like yellow popper

00:27:27	and Cherry a bunch of other things does that make sense yeah it'd be very similar yeah because where you would get would be that lighter that that sun first thing in the morning but it's a relatively low intensity the ground hasn't heated up yet compared to the Western Slope which basically is getting you know you get all that heat build up over the course of the day and by the time you know in the afternoon on a west facing slope it's really hot and most of it's been exposed to a lot of direct sunlight all day does this

00:28:08	make sense okay right here well you can't see them here uh yeah that's actually might be ridges no that's a I'm not sure what that is it's a little hard to tell but just get an idea the point of realizing this is if you have you know south and west facing slopes they're typically going to be much drier and the species that you're going to find there are trees that are better adapted to dry slopes and that's where you're going to find a lot of Oaks typically okay yet if I have a North facing slope which has a

00:28:54	lot more moisture or this Forest is down my Forest Forest is down in the valley where just be by being at a lower slope position it's going to be more fertile I might find those trees that uh you know are require more fertile soils does that make sense all right so and you know there's a basic thing here too is that the amount any but if better quality sites because they have better soils and higher levels of fertility are typically produced more they produce more wood it's just about wood they produce more

00:29:29	habitat produce more stuff okay that's what it comes down to so U and you can use the analogy to Corn it's the same type of thing you know you have a better better site for growing corn it's going to produce more corn well it's the same with the forest and that's why with a lot of folks that manage you know properties especially you know larger ones you put more of your management activity into those better sites because they have a higher return and they're they respond faster and things like that

00:30:00	yeah but again it's well but this would be we're relying upon the basic soil with with forestry we have different issues with regards to aspect and things like that because most corn you know is being planted on on flatter areas much slope is much less of an issue although not really because even on sloped corn fields those those slopes down the bottom of the slopes tend to be more productive even it's a mild slope right well yeah we don't want to take it too far but I mean basically the point here is just to get this idea of the

00:30:39	relationship between site quality and where trees grow in those factors that influence it well I'm not sure I should touch on this but it turns out that um it's kind of interesting that in forestry we use a term called site index and what this this has been developed over years and years and it turns out that all those factors that influence site okay are kind of represented by tree height in other words if you take the same species of tree and you put it on a good site in a poorer site the tree the better site

00:31:16	is going to grow taller in the same number of years just because there's more fertility and everything else does that make sense so they've developed these graphs over the years that basically and usually the year we use is a standard is 50 years but we can go out into a forest where we have trees that are free to grow they haven't been you know suppressed or anything and we can measure the height of the tree and its age and put it on to these these graphs and determine something called site index which basically kind of brings it

00:31:49	back just to say that a 50 years old that's what it comes down to it just says I know it's a little bit complicated but all it does is allows us as Foresters to go out and take a couple basic measurements tree height this tree height is tree height is directly affected by sight sight quality and bring it back to a base age of 50 years old and say oh this is a very fertile this is a very good growing site and there's a lot that's nested in there but if we took these these were two trees where we took two measurements and we

00:32:20	went out there and uh the tree was uh 85 foot tall and 60 years old this is based on Research over years and years we can say that that has a site index of 80 and what that means is that tree is going to be 80 feet tall when it's 50 years old okay just follow me one minute the other one other tree we measured went went out and it was 100 feet tall it was only 40 years old and that has a s index of 110 what that means is that at 50 years old all things being being equal those trees would be 110t

00:33:01	tall and the reason that works is because trees respond to site quality the height of the trees within a broad range of density you have a forest and ones with better soils are just going to produce taller trees in the same amount of time that's a difficult concept I'm just I put it out there because you know as Foresters stuff you have to find a way to kind of get a quantitative way to look at Forest so we can go out with a increment Bor which we'll show you today and we can take find a tree that's been

00:33:36	free to grow through the life of this of the forest and measure its height and measure its age from that we can get an idea of the of the quality of the forest that's growing the quality of the site and its capabilities yeah now this is for similar species obviously yeah and that's why I don't know if you noticed when you went out in the walk this morning but if you looked at that yellow popor Forest we saw those trees were not that old but they were huge now if I went to another site that had poor

00:34:20	fertility and just lower sight quality at that same age those trees would be not as tall you what logically makes sense doesn't it okay so it's the same thing in your garden you know basically based on a certain amount of time more fertile the garden is the taller the you know you're going to get more Tomatoes or whatever so and it just turns out with trees this whole issue of height is kind of directly related to the quality of the site within a broad range of density probably somewhere in there not really could probably get a

00:34:57	better idea looking at some old maps and stuff okay good enough confuse you enough yeah no this is not something that you can do per se unless you have an incr board I only point it out to you to kind of help you understand some of the relationships that are happening out there and some things that a a forest manager would do and and trying to help you understand the basic ecological relationships between how trees grow and you know what are the factors that that influence them and I I question every

00:35:37	time whether I should even bring it up because it is a confusing concept but it's just a way for us to take all those sight factors enter on a a piece of property and kind of get idea of a number higher the number the better it all comes back to the tree the height of that tree at 50 years old yeah uh yeah they'll usually have a site rough not necessarily that accurate but they'll have a site index for things like Oak you know 85 or something which is a pretty good growing site or 60 well anything over 80 is pretty good

00:36:16	but again they're they're based on very scanty data don't give you an idea they'll give you an idea they're good for tree planning some tree planning decisions because it will give you a little bit of information you're try to figure right yeah well you get old photos from the soil conservation service but while that's been digital um I'm not going to get through all this but let's talk about tolerant intolerant species intolerant species are those that can must have full sunlight to grow tolerant

00:36:57	ones can grow in the shade and then there's those that are in between um I'm going to kind of go stop this because I don't want I want to get through some of this but it's the same type of graph it's saying that would this be a this is the the amount of um diameter that a tree is growing over a period of time and this is the amount of sunlight so is this an example of a tree that's intolerant or tolerant in other words it's putting on a lot of diameter growth at a very low level of sunlight so it's tolerant right verus

00:37:27	intolerant okay that's the relationship so we have a thing like a pine tree B Pine tolerant or intolerant to they need full sunlight you're not going to grow in the shade okay you don't go into lavalite Pine Forest and find W cons maybe a few but openings how about yellow popper intolerant you know requires full sunlight you never you you just don't find them growing in the shade of themselves you didn't see any out there this morning for those who went on the walk how about Oaks yeah Oaks are a little different

00:38:02	because they are tolerant of shade they'll establish in the under story and they'll die they'll grow back they'll die and they'll build up this big root system such that when the canopy is removed they can compete with the other vegetation but they still are basically intolerant while they'll establish themselves to they they basically have to have full sunlight to kind of Blossom and be successful so they're kind of intermediate hickories are kind of like that so here's some uh here's some sugar

00:38:32	Maples example of a tolerant Beach uh flowering dogwood right so and here's just the list there's a there's a number of list these are the thing you notice immediately is that a lot of the trees that we rely upon for a lot of forest products and a lot of mass for wildlife are intolerant tree species and you know people talk a lot about clear cutting and and the Crux of of that whole issue is based on this whole issue of Tolerance because people say well we shouldn't clearcut the problem is to regenerate these whole bunch of species

00:39:06	that we want you have to have the canopy removed so you're left with a dilemma because if you just do partial cutting you're going to end up with a lot of lot of Tolerance in many cases they're they're not as desirable and so that's the Crux of a lot of the clear cutting debates so not so it all becomes well how big is the clear cut going to be and maybe it's only going to be a couple acres but you have to provide at least an acre to get enough sunlight to come in that it's going to provide full

00:39:36	sunlight and you're going to get regeneration of those intolerant trees that's what's used on a lot of properties these days what's called group selection cutting where you basically make make a cuting of two or three acres openings in in the forest to allow that regeneration to take place and you scatter that around and you come back number of years later you can do the same thing but you gotta give it full sunlight so this is you know this whole clear cutting debate is really based on this whole issue of Tolerance

00:40:02	which a lot of people just don't understand you're not going to get those species to grow again if you don't have the conditions for them to grow yeah right yeah and you know clear cutting does not cause erosion it's roads to cause AOS and that's why there's been the focus on best management practices to construct roads properly with good dra AG control the water that's what it's all about the cutting itself does not cause erosion it's the roads and that's why there's so much emphasis these days on best

00:40:35	management practices for forestry as well as for agriculture right because in most cases you you you have minimal disturbance you know you you may break up some of the uh uh the upper layer but most of that is going water is going right into the soil reason you have erosion is because water builds up speed and what that where that happens is where you have flat surfaces and and drainage you know builds up where you have a flow of water so the whole idea of building roads and such uh is the same as it is for any type of

00:41:13	application is to make sure that water is dispersed it doesn't build up into a a stream and it doesn't build up speed so by diverting the water off to the side every so many feet things like that that's how you control that yeah I mean everything the root system everything is still there and then you retire the roads that you don't use that's typically the issue so talk a little bit about succession which uh we mentioned here this is a series of pictures that kind of shows what we call Old field succession around

00:41:46	here red cedar comes in start to grow now these are intolerant right and you get some Hardwoods to start to come in over time they start to over top the pine or the the red cedar trees and what you end up over time is that those red cedar trees die out and you end up with a hardwood forest in many cases if you go into your woods and you find the spikes of old red cedar trees that's what exactly what that was that was an Old Farm field and basically the red seedar can only grow so tall they got over topped and they died because they

00:42:19	didn't get more sunlight so you see those spikes in the understory that that tells you what's that's what happened there in the past um and this is the stages you know you have your Johnson grass and other things that come in you start to get some uh Woody shrubs coming in like uhu red bud and all kinds of other things around here a lot of you may have Fields like this and you're going to hear talk about the young Forest initiative what's really missing in a lot of our forest today is Young Forest what we have is a

00:42:50	state full of big trees in many cases Noory because of deer and very little young forest habitat or early successional habitat and for all the wildlife species that rely upon that habitat and um again like I said you have to have the habitat to have the wildlife so for those of you that may have these Meadows like this instead of with red cedar or it could be other things it really it might be worthwhile to consider keeping them open because it's a really unique um habitat so when Hardwoods start to come in you can

00:43:25	either cut them down or you could you cut them and use a little Roundup on Stump or something like that just to stop the hardwoods from coming in and maintain this you know for many years so that's a that's a consideration anybody have this type of thing on their property they're missing because what happens is it grows out of this pretty quick I guess so not true oh right okay right right so with invasive species this is another issue with succession or young Forest it's those young forests are when

00:44:08	these are very susceptible to invasive species um and not just native ones but exotic ones but Honeysuckle and grape vine is a native uh species but it gets pretty invasive and you saw it you saw it out here and the problem is that it gets up into the tops of your trees and it's very big and heavy when you get ice storms and a lot of snow it'll bring your trees down to the ground and one thing you can do in your Forest is keep some gra FS especially on those trees that are not very good quality or

00:44:37	whatever and you just cut off the other ones at the ground and they'll just basically disintegrate and fall apart and there's still plenty left for wildlife but that's kind of a balance between forest and Wildlife so this is when you really need to be vigilant is early on in succession where you have a lot of those invasives U if you're going to do any type of control that's when you get the most bag from the Buck because once they're established you know you're fighting uphill battle early early stage succession but

00:45:05	they tend what happens is that well I think I have a couple of like what happens usually when you get through those earlier stages and the crowns close like you see here all of a sudden the sunlight is cut off to the ground and that's when you lose your you lose the brambles and other stuff and the forest starts to transition so it's kind of a natural development now with Honeysuckle and other things still a lot of these things still stay established in the another story well look back we're in the woods

00:45:35	where we were garlic mustard you know I gotta tell you invasive species you're here to stay you know I haven't seen invasive species we gotten ready yet so yeah oh yeah no that grows up in that stays in the yeah the reg that's part of the part of the plant mix deer eat that stuff it's amazing big that's native yeah Green byer's native it's just people don't like it so we get to stage four what happens is the forest you start getting trees dying and breaking apart you start getting cavities in the trees and uh

00:46:25	that's when you get what's most of the forest that you see around now you know kind of mature forest and then you get to the last stage which would be old growth forest and that beach Forest is actually an example of old growth forest because what you tend to get is you get single trees that'll die out for example from old age you'll get an opening in the canopy you can't really see it here but this tree died and you get some young white comes in you start getting some young saplings and things growing

00:46:49	in there you start getting this you know different uh tiered approach in different bunch of age classes most of our for don't really Reach This level we don't have a lot of old grest U now the stage succession that takes place varies by region so you know if you're up in gar County you have a lot more hathorn in Oldfield succession if you're on the Eastern Shore you probably got a lot of sweet G so the species change you know the the concept stays the same the principles and so like we said you know

00:47:22	the first things that come in are your brambles and your shrubs you get these intolerant tree species around here it's popour and Cherry and things like that and then over time these other ones work up underneath your Toler trains like Oaks and sugar maple and Beach even some Hemlock stuff like that and I have an example of it here um there's some trees that just are early successional trees this is everybody know what Virginia pine is seen that grow it grows up very dense it grows up in Old Fields and

00:47:51	things like that and um but it's very shortlived you know these trees after about 30 40 years they're falling over you been down through Fort me and places down there with all those you know that's if you have that on your property you really need to do something about it before it starts to break up like that and it can be cut for pulpwood and it can be replanted or in many cases this is actually from Fort me can you see what's underneath here it's a little hard to see but you have an idea what

00:48:18	that might be the smaller trees with the light colored leaves that's Beach so basically this is old Virginia Pond old army land down there in fact I got arrested for almost arrested for taking this picture you don't want to you don't want to stop along Route 32 to take a picture okay um but basically yeah this is going to be a beach this is going to be a beach Forest it's that going into that second later stage succession uh and tree planting is when you start looking at management activities you're really managing

00:48:55	succession that's what you're doing so when you're planting trees you're pushing succession ahead right we're short circuiting the whole thing you know on the other side of that if we're harvesting we're kind of pushing it back to an earlier stage to start over again does that make sense so think about lot of management activities really is what you're managing succession and when you manage succession what are you do into Wildlife you're managing habitat right so you see how they're connected huh

00:49:27	yeah you're manipulating succession through Forest management practices and by doing that you're managing wildlife habitat and you're managing the type of wildlife that's going to be there so is cutting trees good well if you don't have any early successional forest and you want to have some more diversity it certainly makes sense yeah right and the problem of course becomes we have so many deer that they eat a lot of the Yaks yeah uh there's been a lot of experimentation trying to underplant Oaks into a you know a mature Forest it

00:50:24	really doesn't work what does work is if you can find some ones that have established themselves is to put some type of a a small protector not probably a tall one but something just to allow it to uh protect it from being bitten down in the ground most of the under planning projects I've seen just don't work uh well the trees's got to be about four and a half five foot tall and then you'll get bucks rubbing it hopefully can we stand that but once it gets beyond the point where they can reach and browse the tips of it

00:50:58	so uh somebody talked about horse logging and there was a couple horse loggers around and the good thing about it is that they have very low impact but typically they're more interested in um they're going to be you know harvesting higher quality Hardwoods you're not going to be seeing horse loggers hauling pulpwood it just doesn't really use to happen it's not economical uh so again this is the graph that maybe you want to keep in mind I'm almost out of time but for succession wildlife habitat remember so by Forest

00:51:27	management we're ma we can manage succession we can push it ahead uh push it back and depending on the types of wildlife we're interested in you know we can manage for that and uh later on you hear about turkeys you know well wild turkeys everybody likes turkeys right but you need mature forest for turkeys where they can Roost but you also need or Le you know Meadow openings where they can bring their PTs in and they can get the protein from the bugs so you need two different kinds of habitat all

00:51:55	right right um just real quickly we talked about competition for light water and nutrients all right here we have a forest this tree is Big this one's smaller which one of these is older huh oh they're basically the same age and again you have to think about the forest is a dynamic entity it's constantly they're battling for light into the overstory these were even Forest they all came up at the same time and the reason that tree is bigger because as it grew it was able to find the hole in the canopy and it was able

00:52:33	to be successful and it shaded out the others and so basically these are B these are the same age so um and they have to think about a tree as a factory so more leaves the more food the more diameter it's going to grow once the clown gets up there it has access to more light more photosynthesis more carbohydrates produces more diameter it gets bigger and bigger in contrast to the tree that gets shaded and it it kind of becomes suppressed as we call it in the under story so and this is kind of what a

00:53:05	canopy looks like we have those trees that are dominant and co-dominant and this becomes real important in Forest practice because I mentioned last night this rationale I'm just going to come in and cut the big trees and leave the little trees to grow now what's the problem with that what what what what what is the state of those little trees in many cases you they're they're slow growing they B basically lost out in the battle they have very low Vigor they have very small crowns they're not going to respond to a

00:53:36	thinning if you open these up into full sunlight they're going to be so environmentally shocked they're just going to die right yeah so that's why when you make Harvest decisions and do Forest thinnings we'll take some of these big ones but we're going to leave a lot of we're going to leave a number of the better ones to grow for the future that's what the thinning is about instead of coming in and just taking the best trees and then leaving the junk unfortunately that's what can happen uh in some cases so that's what we want to

00:54:16	avoid right yeah you would have a mix and it would depend on how the spacing it would depend on a lot of factors what you wouldn't want to do is depends on these trees only these intermediates and the suppressed trees to be your future Forest because you would have a very NE a very negative result right yeah we there's ones that just grow in the underst story well again I mean that's where're getting a professional Forester to come in and make some of the help you make those decisions what I'm trying to do

00:54:55	here is just make you realize that what you don't want to do is just Harvest your biggest and best trees and and leave the little trees to grow so and people get approached with that rationale sometimes want to harvest trees and you want to avoid that yeah it just depends on how it was marked and how it was done who made those decisions on what was cut and if you leave it up to a harvester and and I'm not I'm not here to downplay that all loggers are bad I'm saying there are good loggers but the best way

00:56:03	is to have a Forester involved in making those decisions in terms of what should be cut because they're going to make them with a better basis of information so we we'll see some of those things and we're about out of time but this is just the idea of a thinning one thing you got to do is look up the only thing that counts is up there don't look at the trees down here it's it's that fight for the light in the canopy that's happening so when you have a canopy like this and you have a thinning and you remove some trees

00:56:30	you're going to get this and what's going to happen in the course of probably the next three to five years is that's going to totally close in again and those trees that are left are going to grow faster and uh this is just a a couple of wood things I have from a Forester that gave me this but this was a young Oak stand and you can see that at this point of the forest development this forest was thinned and this was not so this is look cookie this is the outside bark so in that crowded state where the trees

00:56:59	were very crowded it grew 25 years that's how much it grew in diameter and for the other Forest which was thin and the trees the crowns had growing room it grew this much in 25 years now not all Forest respond like that I'm just telling you that can be the power of doing a good Forest thinning and of course these trees are much more vigorous much more able to withstand you know insect and disease issues and stuff like that trees are like people right you know when you're run down and everything like that low Vigor you're

00:57:30	going to get chances of you're getting sick are much greater than if you're in good shape and you do your exercises every day eat your weedies whatever so uh we're out of time but uh I think is this is what you want to avoid this is poor harvesting this is a case where they came in and basically left your you're suppressed and a lot of some of your intermediate trees and what happened when they got exposed to full sunlight is they just were shocked and pretty much you ended up with a CLE cut I mean all the trees are dead or

00:58:00	they're poor quality they're not going to amount to much of anything so my point here is just to say if you're going to have thinning done or harvest done you should have a professional Forester involved in helping you make these decisions okay and uh I think that's about it just to talk a little bit about regeneration there's anything here but this is how most Harwood Forest regenerated from stump Sprouts you cut a tree it sprouts produces 100 sprouts and you end up with one or two of them so that whole

00:58:32	Forest that may when you if it's harvest is done there may be 10,000 trees to the acre by the time that Forest is mature there's 150 what happened to all those trees they all died right they all the competition for space all those other trees died out and what forestry in many ways is do is mimicking that natural process you're just but you're directing you're you're making the direction you're making the decision what survives and what doesn't
