In order for a group to collaborate on a project they must share the Git repository. This can be done in a number of ways, but one popular tool for hosting Git repositories is Github (https://github.com/). An account on Github is free and, in order to support Open Source Software development, there is no limit to the number of publicly visible repositories you can host.

It's important to realize that Git and Github are two distinct entities. Although many times they are used together in the same sentence it's incorrect to use them interchangeably. Remember that your entire project history is in the Git repository, and that is local on your machine. A remote host like Github provides a centralized backup of that history.
