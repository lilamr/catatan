Writing is learned by imitation. I learned to write mainly by reading writers who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and by trying to figure out how they did it. nobody will write well unless he gets into his ear and into his metabolism a sense of how the language works and what it can be made to do. 

Another is that the essence of writing is rewriting. Very few writers say on their first try exactly what they want to say. After a lifetime of writing I still revise every sentence many times and still worry that I haven’t caught every ambiguity; I don’t want anyone to have to read a sentence of mine twice to find out what it means.

Writing organizes and clarifies our thoughts. Writing is how we think our way into a subject and make it our own. Writing enables us to find out what we know—and what we don’t know—about whatever we’re trying to learn. Putting an idea into written words is like defrosting the windshield: The idea, so vague out there in the murk, slowly begins to gather itself into a sensible shape. Whatever we write all of us know this moment of finding out what we really want to say by trying in writing to say it.

He said he was going to teach a course called “Chemical Discoveries That Changed the World” and get his students to write papers about them. I liked the title of the course and the idea of changing the world. I asked him what some of the discoveries were.

“One was the synthesizing of urea by a German chemist named Friedrich Wöhler in 1828,” he said. “It was the first time man had made an organic compound, which had always been considered God’s work, and the discovery touched off intense debates about theology and philosophy all across Europe for many years. It shook the foundations of faith.”

Of course I didn’t even know what urea was. Professor Gover told me it was the chief solid component of urine. I also didn’t know that urine had a solid component. But what I did suddenly know was that this was a chemical achievement that went far beyond the chemistry lab.

Now, listening to Thomas Gover’s tales of Wöhler and Mendeleyev and other chemists who journeyed into the unknown, I thought, “What an interesting subject!”—no small thought for someone with chemistry anxiety.

Then I thought: Probably every subject is interesting if an avenue into it can be found that has humanity and that an ordinary person can follow. Writing was such an avenue—perhaps, in fact, the main route.

many scientists have recently begun to write about their fields in language that is not only clear but often eloquent. One of them is the biologist Lewis Thomas, whose books, Lives of a Cell and The Medusa and the Snail, vividly proved that a scientist can also be a humanist. Another is the paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould. In his monthly column in Natural History magazine and in books like The Panda’s Thumb I’ve found myself caught up in the riddles of evolution and the miracles of the natural world. 

Gould never forgets one of nature’s oldest laws: that everybody loves a story. Every month he tells me a remarkable story and then tells me why he thinks it came out the way it did.

Between English at one end of the spectrum and chemistry at the other are many subjects, like economics, that are a mystery to both camps. Some people would say that economics is also a mystery to the economists. But none of us would deny that economics has a tighter grip on our daily lives than English or chemistry. Shouldn’t we know more about its theories and applications? And how about all those other subjects: anthropology, engineering, mathematics, philosophy, political science, psychology, religion, sociology? What can they tell us about how we behave, build, think, govern ourselves and grope for values to live by? They can tell us as much as we want to know. Probably no subject is too hard if people take the trouble to think and write and read clearly.

all of them delighted me with their unexpectedness and their information. They also taught me a lesson about the integration of knowledge: Separate disciplines are seldom separate. Beyond that, I confirmed what I had always believed about my craft—that there’s no subject that can’t be made accessible in good English with careful writing and editing.

It’s by writing about a subject we’re trying to learn that we reason our way to what it means. Reasoning is a lost skill of the children of the TV generation, with their famously short attention span. Writing can help them get it back.

Writing, I reminded them, can’t be taught or learned in a vacuum. We must say to students in every area of knowledge: “This is how other people have written about this subject. Read it; study it; think about it. You can do it too.”
