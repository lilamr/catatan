Latex is a typesetting language primarily designed for technical and scientific documents. While it provides excellent control over layout and typography, it can be overly complex for simpler, non-technical documents like novels.

The main drawbacks of using LaTeX for novels and similar creative writing tasks are:

1. Steep learning curve: LaTeX has a significant learning curve, requiring users to familiarize themselves with various commands, packages, and formatting options. This can be time-consuming and frustrating for authors who simply want to focus on their writing.
2. Lack of visual WYSIWYG interface: LaTeX is a markup language, which means authors write the document content and structure, and the final layout is rendered separately. This non-WYSIWYG approach can be less intuitive for authors used to seeing their document as they write it.
3. Difficulty with formatting and layout: While LaTeX excels at producing professional-looking technical documents, its rigid formatting rules may not be the best fit for the more flexible and creative needs of novel writing, where authors may want more control over the visual presentation.

For non-technical documents like novels, the software better suited for the task would be word processors or dedicated writing software, such as:

1. Microsoft Word: A popular and widely used word processor that provides a user-friendly WYSIWYG interface, robust formatting options, and a range of tools tailored for creative writing.
2. Google Docs: A cloud-based word processor that offers a similar user experience to Microsoft Word, with the added benefit of real-time collaboration and easy document sharing.
3. Scrivener: A specialized writing software that provides features like project organization, cork board views, and comprehensive editing tools, making it a popular choice for novelists and other long-form writers.
4. Hemingway Editor: A focused writing environment that helps authors improve their writing style and readability, making it a useful tool for the editing and revision process.

The choice of software will depend on the author's personal preferences, the specific features they require, and the level of formatting and layout control they need for their novel or other creative writing projects.

=======================


The two best known are LyX (lyx.org) and Overleaf.

LyX is a local editor available cross platform with a visual interface like Word or any other word processor. It does not show a full rendering of the document as you type but a view similar to the draft view in Word (no pagination, but graphics previewed) and it will generate a PDF in one click. It supports XeLaTeX which means it will use any local fonts (available to all apps) you have installed. This includes OpenType fonts.

Overleaf is an online system which does use LaTeX cide view but gives an instantly updated PDF.
