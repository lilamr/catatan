00:00:02	so this box is mostly full and there's another half box in there I know roughly the book will be divided in three parts so as I think sometimes I've written like this one this is part one so it's going to be part one since say part three so like there's a chapter in discipline that was about time but it started as a punctuality chapter and I actually made the decision yesterday as I was doing the last whene edits I'll show you this is the respect Time chapter and I actually cut this whole story about Harry Truman and I'm going

00:00:32	to move it into this book so we'll do this this will be the first section take one of these put punctuality already have part of the chapter written done so I want to do a chapter on you know that quote sometimes all the taks for evil to Prevail as good men to do nothing and as I was thinking about this I have this quote about Zen from Howard Zen then I thought of the JFK quote then I realized I could open that with the story of his father who's actually the ambassador to England as the second

00:01:07	world war was breaking out and then I just saw a card in here a quote about Marcus Aurelius that one of his biographers wrote let me see ah this is a quote from Henry Sedwick the charge against Marcus Aurelius is that he suffered the criminal law to take its course Markus doesn't stand up as Rome is persecuting the Christians so like serious seriously this is already the core of a chapter you just saw it happen if that's all I do today it's a successful day that's one of the things you realize with a

00:01:39	book you just need to make one or two positive contributions a day and it adds up I did Rogan yesterday and now back at this I only had a short amount of time on these so I'm going to hope to spend some more time today so I'm officially through all the cards that were in this box I have some clear chapters I have some big stacks for part one part two part three I've got some other loose cards to track down but this is the gist of it I've now gone through it and now I have to start making some decisions going through this

00:02:18	is the temperance book here and there's some little chapters that I think I'm going to end up taking so I'm going to use this chapter on the M mentality this is the punctuality chapter which I'm moving this is the clemency chapter I'm moving that one finished this book yesterday you can see quite a number of notes that I have to take so this will get broken down and soon enough be made into note cards along with all these other ones it it struck me that Truman might work as part one of the book and as I'm going

00:02:50	through the notes note card about Truman really good note card about Truman note card about Truman note card about Truman note card about Trum Truman not card about Truman I didn't know that I'd taken this many notes on Truman cuz I the book I I would probably use as the basis for this I read maybe 18 months ago it's one of the wonderful Parts about doing this stuff is you are surprised even by your own notes clearly I recognized something that was usable but I didn't know that I would need it that's the the mystery of

00:03:20	researching for a book is like how do you know that you found what you're looking for if you didn't actually know what you were looking for or earlier you weren't even looking for anything and yet somehow it all comes together and so I'm starting to feel good I have at least the core of part one of the book which is really exciting yeah so I'm I'm I'm sort of in this weird phase on the book where I'm kind of just thinking about so when people think of Justice they think of the legal system when

00:03:45	people think of Justice they think of social justice Warriors but I think for the stoics Justice was the ethical code by which a person lived and then also what we owe each other Marcus talks in meditations like 40 50 times about the idea of the common good that we're all sort of part of this organism and that how we treat other people is the most important thing one of the other early stoics Heracles talks about our sort of circles of concern that obviously you have to be concerned with your own

00:04:18	self-interest but then you know what do you owe your family what do you owe your country what do you owe the world and I think actually the stoic art of justice is about pulling these outer rings closer internally yes a stoic thinks primarily about what's in our control but we also have a lot of control or we have the ability to influence and change the status quo one would one would be mistaken if they thought of stoicism solely as an individual an individualistic thing all the stoks were involved in politics and public life

00:04:53	they served in the army they tried to be a force for good in the world even Within in the you know the limited perview of like trying to focus on what you control yeah I I I heard this quote from anilla Merkel once where she said you know if everyone sweeps their side of the street soon enough the whole village is clean so I do think in stoicism there is this idea that you focus on what's up to you what's in your purview you don't go around being like why are these people acting this way like it's so easy to be like oh the the

00:05:29	people at the US those fools in Washington the you know the EU and Brussels like why aren't they doing this that or the other and meanwhile like there are so many opportunities for courage Temperance Justice and wisdom at home where you do have control you talk about wanting some politician to sacrifice their career you know for some matter of principle and meanwhile like you're afraid to stand up for your to your boss or meanwhile you know the industry you're in is has a a largely negative impact on the world but you're

00:05:59	like like that's just how it works right so I I do think in stoicism uh while they wouldn't give up on the idea of collective action they would just argue that there's a lot of stuff there's a lot of stuff and a lot of ways you can make a difference at home that we just tend to neglect because it's easier it's almost easier to focus on the big stuff cuz then you don't actually have to do anything but the truth is like all politics are local and all change should start at home AAL wor aspect of I I was thinking about this the other

00:06:31	day like whenever I'm driving a rental car like I'm driving one right now like I'm so much more relaxed than I am in my own car like I'm not thinking about what kind of gas mileage is it getting I'm not thinking about you know is it clean I'm just like present cuz it's not my car it's not my stuff and I'm usually in a place that I'm not familiar with so I'm just like way more present than I am at home cuz at home you have stuff to worry about when you're traveling you're in the middle of doing a thing which is

00:06:59	why I think the iics and the Buddhists and you know so many different philosophical and religious Traditions they talk about the importance of presence but they also talk about you know reminding yourself that none of the stuff that you own none of the stuff that you're dealing with is yours like it's all a loner it's all a temporary ephemeral thing which is why you should just be present while you have it not take any of it too seriously and just sort of exist in the moment with the stop for anger or fear is to become a

00:07:32	fugitive a fugitive from Justice so I don't really understand what that means yeah I I that's a good question I don't I don't look Marcus realist isn't always clear about what he means because he's not writing to you or I he's writing to himself he's working out these ideas almost like in shorthand we have to understand that the stoic practice is kind of a dialogue with the self and so I think Marcus is saying like look ideally if we think of about the virtues of Justice if we think about courage and

00:08:02	self-control and wisdom the idea is the world is complicated you know the idea is that people are complicated the the idea is that you should be patient and tolerant and accepting and in control of yourself and look for the good in things and so when you find yourself giving into fear or anger or distrust or despair you're running away from who you're supposed to be I think Marcus is probably thinking about all the annoying people that he deals with in his job and the people who make him you know

00:08:31	challenge his ideas of who he is and how he wants to be in the world what a what a Phil how a Philosophers supposed to sort of make their way through the world and he's reminding himself that he's kind of drifting away from that or running away from that and he has to get back to that you know sort of Ideal that that place of justice and fairness and acceptance and tolerance and patience and I think that's the dialogue he's having with himself not just there in meditations but like throughout meditations and throughout his

00:09:04	life I'm here on a Saturday in June working on the book and it's weird to be thinking about Justice you know after this horrific school shooting in yaldi now the reversal of roie Wade and just a series of sort of Mind numbing and mindboggling either laws or things we're struggling with as a society there's a quote in one of the cards I forget who it was but basically that the purpose of politics is to bring Justice into being in an imperfect world I'm baffled by how hard this is for people there's a a huff

00:09:40	and Post article from many years ago that I love and it said I don't know how to tell you that you have to care about other people but that seems to be where we are as a society we struggle with the idea that we owe anything to other people the decisions or laws we pass have implications or impact on other people I think about this as far as roie Wade goes obviously abortion is a complicated issue you know it's really complicated forcing a woman to give birth to a child I mean I was there for the birth of my

00:10:07	two kids this is not some humdrum minor thing this is insane people die doing it all the time and when we think about Justice too of course we've inherited so many of our Notions of what Justice is from religion and yet the system here in America is primarily rooted in a separation of church and state and I'm just as I sit here doing the these cards that just struggle with how I'm going to make this concept applicable to people on both sides of the aisle appeal to the real angels of our nature the higher

00:10:39	sense of justice what we owe each other what our obligations to each other are to the less fortunate children what we owe the future I don't know it's going to be tough it is what it is like all I can do is get rid it so I was walking through the record store the other day and I noticed he has a bunch of Metallica albums which I love but he had a rare addition of and justice for all which is actually not like one of my favorite Metallica albums of course one is one of their best songs but other than that

00:11:06	like isn't my favorite album but I was kind of thinking and justice for all might be a good title for the justice book so I asked Lippy if I could have it and he said I could he gave it to me as a gift which was very sweet of him but it's going to be a totem on the wall you gave me this Frame also and I'm going to hang it up in my office so I can look at it I like to have like when I'm working on a book I like to have like a quote or a saying or an idea that's kind of like inspiring me as I'm writing and I think

00:11:36	this will be a fun one to look at throughout the course of the book obviously I'll listen to the album while I'm doing it too but put it in anyways I'm going to hang this up on the wall in the office and uh it'll be a nice reminder and uh now it becomes a little bit a part of the story of w writing this book it is July 5th and I am going to start writing today I have my Truman books I have my Truman note cards I was going for a bike ride last night and the first sentences of part one sort of came

00:12:18	to me I've got them here and I'm going to start [Music] writing so it's funny I wrote that do your best chapter for courage originally and then I the you know the Jimmy Carter one yeah and then I moved it to this book now that I'm thinking about how I want to structure part one of the justice book about the sort of personal code of conduct and ethics or whatever I'm wondering if that actually fits better there maybe it does work better in Justice because it it gives you an opportunity to be one of those few

00:12:55	opportunities to be sort of like a little bit raah sure I guess is the you know it's like your you matter your contribution matters what you do in this world matters not just to you as your community to the world and you are robbing the world of your of what you can contribute by not doing your best every day yeah I mean it it basically the whole chapter comes down to the like did you always do your best no and then he says why not that's the the the thrust of that story the whole book is about that but that's not really about

00:13:28	self-control it's more of a principled thing you know what I mean yeah that makes a lot of sense to be to to move into justice for all that it allows you to do in speaking to the reader it just feels like that would fit really well in part one of Justice which is like you have this code of values or principles one is that you always do your best you don't care about the results but you do your best cuz you give all of what you have to whatever it is that you do so basically I'm saying there's like multiple kinds of Justice

00:14:01	right part one is personal Justice regulus keeping his word he said he would come back he came back even even under penalty of death right so like the the first part of the book is all going to be sort of examples of kind of that like personal honor personal ethics and the main character the main example of that is I'm doing Harry Truman which by the way remember you found that stuff for me about Truman and Marcus aelius a while ago like his his reading of meditations and whatnot yeah you found

00:14:27	that in that old book it was like an oral history of Truman yes you have to read that book it's [ __ ] incredible okay it's called it's by Merl Miller and it's called plain speaking but anyway so so Truman is sort of the example of like personal rectitude and responsibility and ethics and all of that right the next part of the book is going to be about communal so like the sort of the common good and I think I'm going to do something I've never done before which is instead of telling One Singular story

00:14:55	like picking one person that embodies that I think I was going to tell the story I was was going to start with the Abolitionist Movement and then the women's rights movement right like I was going to sort of tell like a bunch of different stories if that makes sense like kind of do like this passing of torches rather than one singular person does that make sense yeah obviously the women's hour is a book I'm going to use but and then I'm going to use this book called bury the chains which is about

00:15:20	the Abolitionist Movement but I was wondering if there might be like one or two other books that I could read that would help with that if that makes sense so I was just wondering if you could find me some good recommendations to read chipping away at the book today it's sort of this mix of like writing slash note cards and you're just kind of pinging back and forth it is becoming painfully clear to me as the pandemic wains just how blessed I was to write courage's calling in this bubble of no travel no meetings no inperson

00:15:55	stuff the struggle on this book is going to be finding the time or ultimately books are about large blocks of uninterrupted time and that's the rarest thing in the world not just cuz of my job because I have two young kids and I have a business and I have a life and there's only so many hours in the day but I want to be doing is this and I have to carve out that time and if I don't I won't do the subject Justice I won't do the audience Justice and I'll be robbing myself with the thing I care most about so I was on a bike ride

00:16:27	yesterday and I think think I got the three parts of the book nailed down first would be the Principal like you as the principal the the the personal we have to reform ourselves before we can bring Justice into the world the second would be the cumal this is when we start to care about other people then the third would be the cosmic the heroic kind of justice that you might see in a Gandhi or the kinds of figures that I talked about in part three of the courage book so this is big I mean I vaguely knew what I wanted but now I

00:17:00	have names for them which is a big breakthrough and now I just got to get writing I'm wrapping up the intro which is good and then trying to do a lot of reading so I'm technically on vacation but I'm not on vacation from the book I'm on vacation from doing the stuff that I don't want to be doing the book being what I actually want to be doing and so obviously work family balance but I'm trying to spend about a good hour a day on the book which an uninterrupted focused hour can make a huge difference

00:17:28	and so I think I've polished up the intro now and then I'm going to go back to part one when I finish this up so I wanted to do a chapter in the book about responsibility which to me is related to Justice the idea of like taking ownership of Life of your own actions of your own decisions and this is kind of kind of how my process works it's kind of cool I wrote this note card to myself I must have read this book it's a a scottberg wrote a book about Maxwell Perkins the editor of Fitzgerald I mean

00:17:56	this is before I even used started using these note cards so this this this note card is probably 7 years old 8 years old and it it's it's about this story about how as a Young Man Maxwell Perkins watches a friend nearly drowned and he takes from this this idea that he's he says the lesson I learned from this is to never refuse a responsibility and I don't have the book on me cuz I'm here on vacation but I wrote page 28 Maxwell Perkins book and I pull it up and this is just the [ __ ] most perfect story

00:18:25	that I could have possibly found like this is the the story story that I want to tell in the book and you write these notes to yourself some of them turn out to be nothing and some of them turn out to be exactly what you needed even though you could not have possibly conceived of needing it when you wrote it and that that's just the part of the process that I love so much my forward momentum is the most important thing and I have a lot of forward momentum right now so I'm going to Mark these to come

00:18:48	back to later in sort of a pseudo editing refining polishing phase for now I want to keep the momentum going which is writing new stuff generative stuff I think momentum is the most important thing right if you get bogged down in the weeds if you edit while you write someone once told me you get stuck up it's even a thing in the Bible he says you know don't look behind you as you plow cuz the the horse will Veer in going forward that's how kind of how I think about it I don't want to be too concerned with what I have to do behind

00:19:17	me how it's been going behind me I want to think about where I'm going next so I've been away quite a bit as I've been U vacation then I travel and then I did speaking EG it's been a way I'm getting caught up on the calendar the daily St calendar which I have and it's just a reminder like the days they fly by they fly by when you're working right you lose track of time which is a wonderful experience when you're working on a book but also to me it's a reminder The Stokes talk about momento Mory it's a

00:19:42	reminder that you can lose precious days weeks months go by like that if you're not careful if you're not showing up every day if you're not doing the work you know you look up and a years's gone by and you're not really any closer to finishing that's what happens if you're not present if you're not disciplined if you're not organized if you don't have a system if you structure you're not dedicated that's what happens it's a reminder to me as this time goes by that's time I'll never get back so what

00:20:08	do I have to show for it I have the wonderful experiences with my family I have some relaxation but I also got pages I made positive contributions on the project I move the ball forward I developed some momentum and that's the most important thing on any big project like a book so I've really been struggling with the title for the new book when I started the project I was thinking and justice for all but what what I really don't like about that is it's not telling you what to do and more importantly it perpetuates something

00:20:36	that I try to address in the intro of the book is this drafted the intro of the book which is that when we think Justice we think the legal system we think how government treats people we think of this large expansive things we don't necessarily think about what we do how we act as human beings and our sort of everyday actions and decisions when I think of virtue for the stoks or the virtue of Justice I think they meant more like do the right thing that's something Marcus really says suggest that you do the right thing the rest

00:21:01	doesn't matter and I was just writing this note card to myself I I wrote right thing right now and I I don't know there's a part of me that I think that might be the title like that's tattoo worthy that's a command it's got an alliteration to it it's not quite like courage is calling or discipline is Destiny it's not like the word is blank but in some ways it's almost better so you know you never know where these breakthroughs on titles go I'm working on this other project for summer right now and we're like brainstorming these

00:21:27	list and list and list of things to hopefully get to a title and then this random phrase just came to me so I think right thing right now I don't know I wouldn't be surprised if that's where the book ends up or something along that line I mean obviously you could do you could do just do the right thing or do the right thing there I don't know that's not quite it either maybe it is but there's a little breakthrough and it's coming at the end of August the book is a little over a third done I'm moved on to part two of the book so part

00:21:55	of the reason can be sometimes rare that you don't know the title at the outset is you don't know the book until you've written it or you've written a chunk of it and as the book becomes clear and clearer to me what I'm really feel like this book about Justice is really about it's about doing the right thing which can include designing a government or a culture or an organization that does the right thing but really we're talking about you and I doing the right thing and that's what I want this book to be

00:22:18	about and that may well be the title I'm in New York to do press for the discipline book but I'm in the middle of writing the justice book and I wanted to stop here this is the African burial ground Memorial monument thousands of bodies of African slaves were buried here over a 100 or so odd years and then totally forgotten about forgotten about not just literally but forgotten about figuratively as a part of American history and you can't think about Justice in this country without thinking about the profound injustices that have

00:22:48	happened here time and time again in fact if just right there just right there is a US Courthouse the juxtaposition of this profound Injustice and supposedly a Hall of Justice right is there it's always there and when you read about these high-minded ideals it's very easy to get inspired and I've loved that on the part of writing the book but then you also have to go to the depths of it you have to explore the unpleasant Parts you have to explore this part of wisdom as well you have to explore the

00:23:19	parts of it that challenge you that make you deeply uncomfortable and if you're not seeking out things that make you uncomfortable that challenge you you're probably not practicing philosophy or St ISM you're not pursuing wisdom and you're certainly not in pursuit of Justice which I think the sto would say in the end is rooted in truth it's rooted in fact and so I'm taking a couple minutes just to sit here and meditate on that before I run and go do media appearances today and tomorrow it is now September and writing's going

00:23:47	okay but the number one thing you do when the writing starts to slow down if you're losing the momentum to me that's not writer Block it's that you don't have enough material and so now it's time to go through some more note cards these are part two note cards and uh I just got to go through them and I'll find the stuff that I need and something to get excited about it is now midt 2022 and the book's going okay the problem is I just had the busiest week of my life on Monday I was in Denver on Tuesday I

00:24:16	had a talk here and then I went and saw Iron Maiden uh Wednesday I flew to Las Vegas then I was in sarog Gordo which is a ghost town that I own and and another YouTube channel that I've helped build then Thursday I was doing interview in La when Friday I was doing interviews in La Saturday I was here signing books today it's Sunday and I'm signing more books I had one good writing day this week I did some reading which was good while I was traveling but I on Tuesday I got like maybe 2 hours in it is

00:24:44	extremely hard to write when you're also marketing another book and the way this schedule has worked out it's as I am putting one book out into the world the other one needs to be written and there's not enough time and not enough hours in the day and that's been the grind and it's not just a grind like it wasn't just hard to be away from my family and stuff the the hard part is I love writing I love working on this book and I just I just haven't had the time so I'm here on Sunday very understanding

00:25:08	wife and kids trying to play a little bit of catchup do a little bit of work going through some note cards so that when I come back tomorrow and the kids are in school and I've got more or less a full day I can make up for some lost time which is really how I feel I'm trying to remind myself speaking of discipline that I set the pace the book does not set the pace the deadlines are important but they are also Illusions but I also want to be fair to other people inv involved in the process I want to be fair to the work don't want

00:25:36	to cheat it and I really enjoy doing it and so I have to be better at making time I have to be better at saying no or I'm just not going to get over the finish line and I have a chapter in this book about Justice isn't just what you isn't just acts of Charity it's also like doing the work that you're meant to do and having a positive impact through that work and I have to remember that when I'm saying saying yes to stuff and I have a sign here on my wall that says no for a reason when I'm saying yes to

00:26:03	stuff I am cheating the stuff that matters both my family and the work it's not an exaggeration to say that that there is an injustice in that because the book that someone buys won't be as good as it could be but more importantly it won't necessarily get to the truth of the idea the philosophy that I care so much about and uh I've got to get there it's coming a little sooner than I wanted it to but I got an email from my publisher this morning said it's already time to begin working up covers the

00:26:32	original working title when I sold it was just do the right thing but I don't think that's going to be the title of the book and she said do you have a final title and subtitle that you can share and as it happens I wrote this down on a note card hang on I wrote down a potential title on a note card right thing right now and so I said I'm not there yet but I'm leaning towards right thing right now and she said they just want something that's in the ballpark of the working title for design which is

00:26:59	going to begin next week on the 28th and uh so I gave her right thing right now Justice in an unjust world it's not perfect it's not exactly what I want or maybe it will become exactly what I want but as it happens I'm actually working on this chapter right now right thing right now which I'm building around Jimmy Carter so I was probably halfway through the book before this idea popped to me and before I even wanted to tackle the subject matter exactly but here we are and you never know where the title

00:27:27	The Packaging all of it end up but you got to start somewhere in the discipline book I talked about not being a perfectionist let me try this on walk around in it see how I think it may well end up being the title of the book all right it is September 12th 242 coming in at 181 Pages 76,6 63 words including the afterward and the acknowledgements right thing right now is ready to go in to publisher that's what it looks like I'm going to save it I will await your notes then we grab the you can see here

00:28:04	look here's all the notes from self- discipline so this became a word draft I used Google Docs before but this became a word draft Allin one thing May 19th 2022 and here it is there's June July August September and then copy the Dropbox link and send it over done I was tweaking the title right thing right now now and then where's the punctuation in that and then the subtitle the working subtitle was Justice in an unjust world then I was wondering do you kind of spruce it up is it like living with

00:28:38	Justice or acting with Justice I didn't I want people to understand that what I'm saying is that it's Justice that you do as opposed to like a societal argument about what Justice should be so as a result of kind of opening that Pandora's Box then we got feedback on the cover so this is the cover they're having me look at that's discipline I like orange I don't know if it's the right Vibe we're still working on what the blur should be but I think the real problem all these have a solid color border and then this to have color in

00:29:10	the Border I think it makes the cover knot stand out so anyways there's all things you have to think about basically what they were saying is that the strategy was too muted the cover was too muted so that's why we're back kicking it around yeah it's just too it's taking away from the you're seeing this before you're seeing this like see how the cover like the title pops on each one of them cuz the the reality is discipline is just when you look at it most people are going to interact with a cover as an

00:29:40	Amazon thumbnail and they're going to see it here so if you have these other colors what's not popping is the title it's all in the thumbnail it's all in the thumbnail so how will it pop as a thumbnail I think you want and I think I like that discipline is dark versus am might dark it anyway okay so we got to fix that it's actually a hard thing like you don't think about it but like you have to be like really protective and on guard because like there's so many cooks working on a project that people

00:30:07	accidentally or kind of maliciously they they're trying to put their stamp on it or they're trying to control things so like if you don't have a strong sense of like what everything's supposed to look like it creates opportunities for other things and you don't actually realize that it's important to you until too late like for instance like I was just finding out that in Courage I signed the afterward like my name and where I was and then I meant to do that for discipline and then I but I didn't get

00:30:32	in there or I supposed to be there in discipline in a movie they have a what's called a continuity editor and their job is just to make sure like oh no no when we filmed that scene last time like this cup was over here and this or like actually you're wearing a hat that would not be from that time period And so you don't really have that imp poing but you do have to be on top of all the details because if you're not somebody who cares less than you will make that decision and it can cumulatively impact the

00:30:57	overall quality so this is like like somebody just made the decision to change the border and it consistently it it violates the continuity of the first two um which if you're doing intentionally would be one thing but I'm not doing that intentionally that's like a thing they inserted into the process and so now I have to sort of go back and fix that there is some part of me that's not convinced that orange like orange may be the right color as far as this evolution of title like evolution of red

00:31:30	pops blue pops orange pops it might like work as a cover but is orange the color of Justice I don't know like what is but what is the color of Justice I don't know but like so yeah see you see boom boom is orange next to that like will it pop sure but do you go courage discipline I don't know Green is my only thought I think I think green is actually what I originally suggested I know I've seen a Green version dark green I've never done green then also you have to think about like what other covers or colors have used before

00:32:05	all right so the publisher sent me back cover samples from what we're talking about they're actually fast this is only a few hours difference but they fix the border and then I asked for a couple different shades of orange which of these Pops I think it's I think it's not that one it's not that one between these two which one Pops to you the most or the least the red is the most this one yeah the least is the one next to it this yeah that's the one we like the most um I think you I don't think you can do red because look how

00:32:47	similar these are it's very similar to that one and I feel like yellow is could they change the background beige to something else I mean like change what the the whole background color of beige I don't know cuz then the first first two are one and then the second is the third is different although they I mean they clearly changed a little bit this one seems like yeah it I feel like we should this should come to pop like that D I'm going to forward this to you go see what they think okay but I don't

00:33:12	want to Prejudice it so just get get some thoughts which one do you like the best on the top beautiful so that's the first one [Music] two for me but Red's my favorite color I think either that one you like this yeah I like either that one or that one like courage yeah that's definitely too much too much like courage I agree oh the one oh maybe that's yeah the number two but I think you're right it's exactly like CR like this one a lot of votes for red here yeah um yeah it is exactly like hot Courage the thing with the orange it's

00:33:57	so light like the third one this one yeah well I was saying make it yellow I thought it was yellow it's like gold yeah that's orange yeah I like that one too if it's going to be orange wait so what are the V I don't think any of us agree so I like two but it looks too much like Kur so I think number one one yeah I say one or three one or three I like four four 1 2 three four popular you know the dark orange the the first one like Chelsea voted for one and three one and three what is that well three is yellow like the oh so but

00:34:30	the yellow got the least one I those at least like in terms of like the conversation but they're all evenly spread out over the other ones yeah yeah okay which of these covers do you like better which pops and I know it's the whole point is that it's supposed to look small and not that great this one this one this one or this one I think it's two I said that yesterday did you I think it's two yeah I think it's two red one I think it's two but it's so close no it's not no no look it's too close to this it's

00:35:00	too close to courage yeah it's too close to courage it's the wrong it's the wrong color entirely exactly like Purge yeah maybe we need to go to green the reason that we're looking the reason we like it is because it looks just like Purge and the other ones don't look right because they look off from Courage they're too close all right green it is did you start with green I think so I was looking at yourself like this stands out yeah but it'll still be this no what I'm saying but like as far as a color

00:35:28	green would be nice I think you got to go [Music] green I mean the whole thing would be cool green but okay here let me order she's not going to be pleased I just don't think orange works it's too similar to courage Sam said she had another green that she liked oh this green that's pretty cool too right mhm that's a cool green M mhm that's kind of like a lime green like that's kind of bright I like that I think like if you do what is that like hunter green I think that might be too dark yeah but it I like how this is kind

00:36:16	of like a like that's pretty bright ooh this is good too well it is November and officially Sweater Weather and I am in the middle of part three now I've written a couple of the chapters and I am now just going back through my note cards to start I I have a good sense of what chapters I have to do left so I know who the main character of part three is going to be I'm going to write about Gandhi now that I have a better sense of where I'm going I can go back through the cards and start to get a sense of where they're all going to go

00:36:45	and use all this material that I've you the weird part is I've found stuff as I've been writing and it's like okay I like this but it doesn't work for part one maybe it'll work for part two I'm like wri in part two and I I love it and I go but still I can't use it now I'm running out of Runway and so I'm starting to think about how I how I want to use all this stuff but I wouldn't say I feel like I'm on the downhill of the book but I feel like I know what this book is I know where it's going and I

00:37:11	know that if I don't stop in the next few months I will get to the end of a first draft which is a really good feeling especially considering where I was you know six or so months ago wondering if I you know needed to ask for more time if I was going to have to push this whole thing a year so I'm I'm uh chugging away well it's almost Thanksgiving the book is going along well but I hit a hiccup today because uh yesterday I was playing basketball in Austin and I'm pretty sure I broke one or two of my fingers and it is going to

00:37:41	make typing a little bit strange it's actually funny on trust me I'm lying I was riding my bike and I fell and I broke my elbow and it kept me out for about 6 weeks so I'm left-handed so I I couldn't PPE I had a bunch of notes that I was supposed to do this week I'm I'm almost done with this long book about Gandhi and I have to transfer all it to no Cards into the book that is not going to happen I'm going to try to do a little bit more editing today because the editing requires less finger Mobility but actually the first thing

00:38:08	I'm going to do today is look at the covers let me show you this Megan is the editor's assistant and she sent me right thing right now covers these are the mockups right now the title is right thing right now which I like I don't know if I want this comma in there so there's these this these are the supposed to be the scales of Justice I guess I like that one so I guess the big thing is going to be the color scheme so discipline was blue courage was red what color do you do for justice what about

00:38:37	green green could be a cool color well it is December 2022 and it took longer than I thought or expected but I have finished the Gandhi section I printed it out it's 7500 Words which is way longer than I want it to be but it is done so I have kind of maybe one chapter left to do here in the book I want to do one on what Gandhi actually calls the great Oneness about sort of part three of the book that we're all the sort of interconnected entity as the stoics would say uh this idea of sympath or Mutual interdependence so I got that to

00:39:11	do and then I'm going to send this thing into the publisher which is just unbelievable for me to say but then look I got to show you I had some new covers the publisher sent me some covers that I have to look at I like that I think I like that so they did it as silver which I think is pretty cool especially if it was shiny that's pretty [ __ ] sick I think Silver's it man guess it was 18 months ago I at this table started laying out the note cards for what would be the justice book I didn't know had a very different title very

00:39:53	different understanding of it this box is not nearly as full as it is now but I have in my hand the first printed designed manuscript which is called first pass pages in publishing right thing right now so this is where you're seeing what it will look like designed out as it is in the book really for the first time so you're seeing like all the things like table of contents so the pages line up symbols and so you're basically looking here for mistakes errors you you can like I have a couple note cards I have to add in but this is

00:40:35	the manuscript back of Justice these are all the [Music] notes all right so this is second half pages of right right now yep here it is I'm trying to get this sentence right for the cover copy it says history gives us many examples of how strong sense of justice can turn Ordinary People and the heroes from Truman's obsession with personal Integrity even when no one is paying attention to Susan B Anthony's willingness to be imprisoned in her fight for equality to Gandhi's commitment to a cause that freed

00:41:06	Millions from oppression and violence I think I want to say something like to Gandhi's uh uh inspiring campaign that let Millions to self rule in India and the problem is you never know when you're just fiddling what do you think this is the new subtitle good values good character Good Deed you think I should get a new photo or should I use this one again this one yeah looking sideways that one I kind of think we should use the same for all four you know what I mean I should use it for all four I agree yeah

00:41:54	all right Let's do let's not do that the subtitle of this book is probably the one I have struggled with the most I with ego as the enemy I I cut the gordian knot by just not having a subtitle and I was seriously leaning towards that I wanted to go with Justice in an injust world I don't know I just I I was really concerned that people would think the book is not for them with the title it being about the right thing instead of about Justice I I was really happy with that's more in line with what

00:42:25	I think the sto virtue is it's not like legal Justice or political Justice it's it's about what kind of person you are and so it's funny I went round and round and round and then my UK publisher I I publish in the UK with this company called profile who they they've done all my books they're amazing Louisa was here visiting we had lunch across the street at base camp I was showing her the note cards for fourth book in the series cuz they're publishing that also and the UK Edition was having to find and she was

00:42:51	like look we we just really have to pick a subtitle and we were just ripping and she she said something what she was like what about good values and good judgment like that and I that weirdly that unlocked the idea of oh it maybe it doesn't have to be a sentence it could just be like three phrases I'll actually show it to you so we were riffing with her an inner compass for a lost world that was a late this is all like 20 potential subtitles in like super late in the process like I mean this is the second pass of the book

00:43:23	so we were way late inner compass for Lost World find your North Star from selfish a self lless decency and indecent world and then she threw out good judgment good character good deeds and then that was what I proposed to my publisher and then literally as I was writing about it I suggested good judgment good character Good Deed that they were like okay we like the path to goodness in an injust world or in an unjust World it still had justice in there so I didn't like it and then they said good judgment Good Deeds good

00:43:51	character and then I I said H let's do the good one how about good values good character Good Deeds so February of 2024 having started the book in June of 22 finally figured out the subtitle so that's how long it is the title itself was this whole crazy thing in the proposal in the four virtues proposal the book was called just do the right thing that was the title of the book and then the working title of it I framed it in commemoration the work the working title of the book when I started writing

00:44:27	it was in a notto Metallica Injustice for all just do the right thing became Injustice for all which became right thing right now and then the subtitle all these years later finally got settled this proposal was written in the summer of 2019 it took from the summer of 2019 to the winter 24 to figure out the title and subtitle of the new book which I am now finally very very happy with so I'm doing sign cop copies of the justice book or right thing right now as it's called and the publisher wants me to do 15,000 so they

00:45:03	don't send you 15,000 books they send you I guess it' be 7500 sheets right one page two page this gets bound into the book in the printing process so they print it basically some pages early so someone on my team has to number all 15,000 pages and I have to sign it so this is one and two three and [Music] four now I just have to do that what 1,500 more times that math right way more uh anyways I'm going to have to do this a lot so the way you do big things the way you do hard things is you do them in pieces the great Xeno line is uh

00:45:42	well-being is realized by small steps but it's no small thing I am in the middle now of having somewhat foolishly agreed to produce 15,000 numbered first editions of the new book doing The Virtue Series so this one's on justice so what you do is you sign these tip-ins the tip-ins get bound into the book One of a Kind unique thing but it means I have to sign my name 15,000 times and then I'm going to personalize some I try to personalize like about 10% of them with like little messages and stuff just to keep it

00:46:12	interesting anyways how I think about it is I had someone in my team number them in chunks of 500 so I think about it in blocks of 500 and I'll sit down and I'll go okay I'm going to do 100 or I'll sit down and go you know what tonight after the kids go to bed I'm going to do a whole block of 500 and bring them into the office and then I'm doing in my head okay how many sets of 500 do I have to do to finish this is how I swim like I don't sit down and swim a mile I swim 72 laps right and 72 laps is seven sets of

00:46:42	10 and then I push myself to do two more right when I'm at the limit when I'm writing I go okay I'm going to do a chapter today and then I cross that off and I go and you know what I'm going to do a little bit of of the next chapter right so I'm always just trying to break really big hard tasks down into smaller component pieces Mark talks about this in meditations too he says you assemble your life action by action step by step says basically no one can stop you from that 15,000 copies is a long way from

00:47:09	now I'm not thinking about that I'm not thinking about how much time it's going to take what I am thinking about is am I cracking at it today am I making some positive steps on it today am I just doing a little bit and you know lo and behold uh just even while I'm sitting here talking to this is 96 97 98 so right there's a set of them done and I'm a little bit closer to ending so I was just at my kids Jiu-Jitsu practice and my phone started blowing up and I told my agent I call him back when I got to

00:47:39	the office so let's see what he has to say here Ryan congratulations well what's the what's the word you're number one New York Times number one New York Times advice ahead of all other books no way does it get any better than that no it doesn't it doesn't this this this is number two right this is the second time uh you've had several number ones but uh I guess what in the series this is the first time no no I mean so still this hit number one and then this is the second number one New York Times I don't

00:48:11	think I don't think I've hit it any other times for discipline it was number two right yes I think that's correct oh man there's there's something about hitting a Target as a byproduct of doing what you were trying to do as opposed to aiming at said thing like this is nice but not not not the main goal the main goal was to to do the book and to get it to people and then this is this is a byproduct and look at the net result you vaulted Justice to number one on the New York Times list to me that that's the

00:48:43	craziest thing because I would have guessed that this would be the the um the hardest cell of the of the whole series but but uh here we are I think the way you put it Forward people really engaging in so it's it this doesn't get old my friend no no you know after after belich won his his first Super Bowl someone said you know what what do we do next and he said um we win more of them and uh I don't know if that's exactly the the right Vibe but I do uh let's just I'm going to go do the I'm going to

00:49:15	go work on uh on the wisdom book a little bit as a celebration all right my tradition which I have learned the hard way is that you celebrate the noun getting the accomplishment M or the achievement you celebrate the noun by doing a verb which is what I'm going to do now and that is work on the next book when I wrote The Daily stck 8 years ago I had this crazy idea that I would just keep it going the book was 366 meditations but I'd write one more every single day and I'd give it away for free as an email I thought maybe a few people
