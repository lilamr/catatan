“procedural abstraction. We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)

“Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“Algorithms describe the solution to a problem in terms of the data needed to represent the problem instance and the set of steps necessary to produce the intended result.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“Programming languages must provide a notational way to represent both the process and the data. To this end, languages provide control constructs and data types.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“At a minimum, algorithms require constructs that perform sequential processing, selection for decision-making, and iteration for repetitive control. As long as the language provides these basic statements, it can be used for algorithm representation.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
- Sequence: Steps are executed in order, one after another.  
- Selection (Decision-making, e.g., if-else): Allows the algorithm to choose between different actions based on conditions.  
- Iteration (Loops, e.g., for, while): Repeats a set of steps multiple times until a condition is met.

“All data items in the computer are represented as strings of binary digits. In order to give these strings meaning, we need to have data types.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
“Data types provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
“a data type also provides a description of the operations that the data items can participate in.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
“These simple, language-provided constructs and data types, although certainly sufficient to represent complex solutions, are typically at a disadvantage as we work through the problem-solving process.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)

“Code is a set of step-by-step instructions, like a recipe. It tells computers what to do with data. Data is any piece of information that a computer can hold in its memory.” (Lyman, p. 22)

“In modern software, real-world problems become puzzles that can be solved by code—but only after you truly understand them. Once you wrap your mind around every possible permutation of a problem, you can write code that addresses it thoroughly, step by step.” (Lyman, p. 23)

“The best coders understand problems in terms of an algorithm—a series of steps that can be used to do a certain thing” (Lyman, p. 24)
“every algorithm that can possibly exist can be written in every normal programming language. It’s a mathematical fact21. Once you learn to think in algorithms, the programming language is secondary.” (Lyman, p. 24)
“in the end it’s not about the keywords and symbols you’re using. It’s about the processes you’re describing.” (Lyman, p. 24)

“The last and most important thing I can teach you is this: when you don’t know how to do something, immediately go to google.com and ask.” (Lyman, p. 39)
“all you need to become an expert in any programming language is a steady internet connection and the ability to read. Good Google queries take a little bit of practice to write.” (Lyman, p. 39)

“Most large-scale apps use all the concepts and keywords I’ve described. Their code comprises thousands upon thousands of lines of code, all built from these same basic elements.” (Lyman, p. 39)
“On a basic level, they’re receiving inputs (data that enters the code from somewhere else, like a user’s keyboard), transforming them (often by iterating over them, doing maths on them, or reorganizing” (Lyman, p. 39)
“their properties), and providing outputs (data that leaves the code). Every computer program can be described in terms of its inputs and outputs. Every programming language has methods in its API for accepting inputs and providing outputs.” (Lyman, p. 40)

“I’ve taught you enough programming basics that, with a little imagination and plenty of Googling, you can teach yourself everything you need to know to write apps.” (Lyman, p. 40)
“go build something. There’s no substitute for getting your hands dirty.” (Lyman, p. 40)
