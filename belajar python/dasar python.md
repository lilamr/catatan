“Python supports the object-oriented programming paradigm. This means that Python considers data to be the focal point of the problem-solving process.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 8)
“in any other object-oriented programming language, we define a class to be a description of what the data look like (the state) and what the data can do (the behavior).” (Miller and Ranum, p. 8)
“Data items are called objects in the object-oriented paradigm. An object is an instance of a class.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 8)
