“Sometimes you don’t want to think up a unique name for every property in an object, especially if they’re all very similar. Or you don’t know how many there are going to be. That’s when it’s time to use an array, which is a list of similar pieces of data. Arrays can grow or shrink as needed.” (Lyman, p. 28)
“use an array to hold them all” (Lyman, p. 28)
“it’s a variable just like anything else.” (Lyman, p. 29)
“anywhere in your code, and it will refer to the array we defined” (Lyman, p. 29)
“If you want to refer to a specific string in the array” (Lyman, p. 29)
“we use the number (or index) of the thing (or element) we want to refer to.” (Lyman, p. 29)
“Each of the above expressions (an expression is any code that turns into a piece of data when you run it) is a variable. You can assign something new to it, if you want.” (Lyman, p. 29)
“Arrays can hold strings, numbers, dates, objects, and even other arrays. You can put arrays inside of arrays inside of arrays inside of arrays.” (Lyman, p. 29)
“Arrays can also be properties of objects. An object can have a property that is an array of objects, each of which has a property that is an array of objects...and I’ve done it again.” (Lyman, p. 30)

“Lists, strings, and tuples are ordered collections that are very similar in general structure but have specific differences that must be understood for them to be used properly. Sets and dictionaries are unordered collections.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 11)

“A list is an ordered collection of zero or more references to Python data objects.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 11)
“Lists are heterogeneous, meaning that the data objects need not all be from the same class and the collection can be assigned to a variable” (Miller and Ranum, p. 11)
“when Python evaluates a list, the list itself is returned. However, in order to remember the list for later processing, its reference needs to be assigned to a variable.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 11)
“lists are considered to be sequentially ordered” (Miller and Ranum, p. 11)

“You should also notice the familiar “dot” notation for asking an object to invoke a method. my_list.append(False) can be read as “ask the object my_list to perform its append method and send it the value False.”” (Miller and Ranum, p. 13)

“One common Python function that is often discussed in conjunction with lists is the range function. range produces a range object that represents a sequence of values. By using the list function, it is possible to see the value of the range object as a list.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 13)
“The range object represents a sequence of integers. By default, it will start with 0. If you provide more parameters, it will start and end at particular points and can even skip items.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 13)

“there is an alternative method for creating a list that uses iteration and selection constructs. The is known as a list comprehension. A list comprehension allows you to easily create a list based on some processing or selection criteria. For example, if we would like to create a list of the first 10 perfect squares, we could use a for statement” (Miller and Ranum, p. 25)

“Strings are sequential collections of zero or more letters, numbers and other symbols. We call these letters, numbers and other symbols characters.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 13)
“Literal string values are differentiated from identifiers by using quotation marks (either single or double).” (Miller and Ranum, p. 13)
“strings are sequences” (Miller and Ranum, p. 14)

*String Formatting*
“The left side of the expression holds the template or format string, and the right side holds a collection of values that will be substituted into the format string.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 21)

“Tuples are very similar to lists in that they are heterogeneous sequences of data. The difference is that a tuple is immutable, like a string. A tuple cannot be changed.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 15)

“A set is an unordered collection of zero or more immutable Python data objects. Sets do not allow duplicates” (Miller and Ranum, p. 16)

“an unordered structure called a dictionary. Dictionaries are collections of associated pairs of items where each pair consists of a key and a value.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 18)
