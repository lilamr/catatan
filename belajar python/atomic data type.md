“Python has two main built-in numeric classes that implement the integer and floating point data types. These Python classes are called int and float. The standard arithmetic operations, +, −, `*`, /, and ** (exponentiation), can be used with parentheses forcing the order of operations away from normal operator precedence. Other very useful operations are the remainder (modulo) operator, %, and integer division, //. Note that when two integers are divided, the result is a floating point. The integer division operator returns the integer portion of the quotient by truncating any fractional part.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 8)

“Boolean data objects are also used as results for comparison operators such as equality `(==)` and greater than (>). In addition, relational operators and logical operators can be combined together to form complex logical questions.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 9)
