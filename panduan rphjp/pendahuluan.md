The purposes of C&I for SFM vary with geographic scale of application. At national or regional scales, C&I are used as policy instruments to evaluate and adjust laws, policies and regulations. At the scale of forest management unit, C&I are used primarily for evaluating and adjusting management practices.

In this paper, we have two objectives: (1) to illustrate the usefulness of a logic-based approach to utilizing the Montreal C&I in evaluating the sustainability of forests and their benefits and (2) to identify the roles of science and policy in this effort. To accomplish these objectives, we will construct a prototype framework for utilizing C&I in assessing sustainability, highlight the policy choices that must be made in this construction, and discuss some of the lessons we learned from this effort.

Our primary objective is to show how formal knowledge representations can help reveal the myriad of decisions involved at the scienceypolicy interface of SFM, as well as bring transparency and consistency to the evaluation process.

The Montreal specifications provide relatively clear definitions of biophysical, socioeconomic and framework attributes requiring evaluation. However, design of evaluation procedures that allow interpretation of the Montreal C&I is one of the major technical issues that remain to be resolved. The design of any model that purports to evaluate sustainability with respect to a set of C&I must necessarily incorporate value judgments and other subjective elements, and this is no less an issue for biophysical aspects as it is for socioeconomic ones.

=====================================

4 steps as part of the adaptive management process: 
1) Define an objective or goal for the management; 
2) Develop a model for your management strategies - this model maybe only conceptual, but typically is a mathematical model; 
3) Implement a management option; and 
4) Evaluate the impact of the management implemented.
