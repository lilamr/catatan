Regardless of the type of work you're doing, it's immeasurably rewarding to contribute your talents to the world of Open Source software. Find a project on Github you use, or like, or believe could be better. Use the command:

`git clone`

to get a copy of the project's codebase for yourself to work on and improve. Github provides instructions for submitting a “Pull Request” (https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to have your changes reviewed and included by the project maintainer.
