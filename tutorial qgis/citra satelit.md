Satellite remote sensing has been shown to be an effective means for regional-scale phenology observations (Dixon et al., [2021](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0013); Landmann et al., [2018](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0025)). Phenological remote sensing of dipterocarp forests of Southeast Asia has, however, continued to pose a challenge due to persistent cloud cover in the region. While medium resolution (10–30 m) satellite data such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 have the potential to observe individual crown-level phenology, their utility is limited as they often fail to image land surface due to their low temporal resolution (5- to 16-day repeat cycle) (Torbick et al., [2017](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0053)). Coarse resolution (250 m to 1 km) satellite data such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) have temporal resolution high enough (1- to 2-day repeat cycle) to obtain cloud-free scenes, but their spatial resolution is too coarse to obtain phenology information in this biologically-diverse forest. For example, MODIS green-red vegetation index time series data could not detect surface color changes due to flowering in this region (Nagai et al., [2014](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0036)).

The advent of high-temporal and high-spatial resolution commercial satellite remote sensing has brought about the possibility of observing and characterizing GF in unprecedented spatial detail (Brandt et al., [2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0006); Wagner et al., [2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0056)). PlanetScope, in particular, can obtain high spatial resolution (3–4 m) images on a nearly daily basis (Planet Team, [2017](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0043); Roy et al., [2021](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0046)) and has been applied to a wide range of ecological and environmental studies, especially for detecting ephemeral and/or small changes on landscapes (Cheng et al., [2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0010); Cooley et al., [2019](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0011); Csillik et al., [2019](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0012); Helman et al., [2018](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0015); Xu et al., [2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0059); Yamano et al., [2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0060)). Sakuma and Yamano ([2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0050)), for example, used PlanetScope time series data to classify crop types on a subtropical island in Japan. Likewise, Wang et al. ([2020](https://esj-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1440-1703.12382#ere12382-bib-0057)) demonstrated the utility of PlanetScope time series data to assess seasonal changes in both ecosystem- and crown-scale spectral reflectance in Central Amazon.
