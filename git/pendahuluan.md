Git (http://git-scm.com/) is a popular, free Version Control System. With Version Control you can, in effect, rewind time. By capturing snapshots of your progress, any stage in a project can be revisited and modified quite freely. You even have the ability to cherry pick certain changed files and merge them with others from different points along your project's timeline.

One of the things that makes Git special is that it's local—in other words, based on your own computer. Since Git is file-based, it works with anything you can create or manipulate on a computer—text documents, image files, audio or video—and you can easily share or transport your work to other computers, even as an email attachment.

When collaborating, Git as an Source Code Management (SCM) systems, enables all members of a team to work independently, and easily blend together the best of each contributor's efforts into a final product. An SCM system helps to resolve conflicts among files and conflicts within a file as a result of multiple people making changes to the same file.

The key concept in understand Git is the idea of history. Git records snapshots of the collection of files in your project. Our goal when using Git is to capture snapshots of our work. Rather than just having copies of the files in use, we can review the progression of work, reassemble it, rearrange it and repeat it as desired. It will be easier to grasp the use of Git if you keep in mind this concept of history, as most of the tasks you do in Git are related to moving through the history of your work.

Git is not to be confused with Github! (https://github.com/) Although the names are similar, Github is a very popular website that hosts version control repositories (primarily Git repositories).
