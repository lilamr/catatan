00:00:00	ROGER MARTIN: This thing called planning has been around for a long, long time. People would plan out the activities they're going to engage in. More recently, has been a discipline called strategy. People have put those two things together to call something strategic planning. Unfortunately, those things are not the same, strategy and planning. So just putting them together and calling it strategic planning doesn't help. What most strategic planning is in the world of business has nothing to do with strategy.

00:00:34	It's got the word, but it's not. It's a set of activities that the company says it's going to do. We're going to improve customer experience. We're going to open this new plant. We're going to start a new talent development program. A whole list of them, and they all sound good, but the results of all of those are not going to make the company happy because they didn't have a strategy. [MUSIC PLAYING] So what's a strategy? A strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way

00:01:13	that you win. So there's a theory. Strategy has a theory. Here's why we should be on this playing field, not this other one, and here's how, on that playing field, we're going to be better than anybody else at serving the customers on that playing field. That theory has to be coherent. It has to be doable. You have to be able to translate that into actions for it to be a great strategy. Planning does not have to have any such coherence, and it typically is what people in manufacturing want-- the few things they want, to build a new plant,

00:01:50	and the marketing people want to launch a new brand, and the talent people want to hire more people-- that tends to be a list that has no internal coherence to it and no specification of a way that that is going to accomplish collectively some goal for the company. See, planning is quite comforting. Plans typically have to do with the resources you're going to spend. So we're going to build a plan. We're going to hire some people. We're going to launch a new product. Those are all things that are on the cost side of businesses.

00:02:30	Who controls your costs? Who's the customer of your costs? The answer is, you are. You decide how many square feet to lease, how many raw materials to buy, how many people to hire. Those are more comfortable because you control them. A strategy, on the other hand, specifies an outcome, a competitive outcome that you wish to achieve, which involves customers wanting your product or service enough that they will buy enough of it to make the profitability that you'd like to make. The tricky thing about that is that you don't control them.

00:03:15	You might wish you could, but you can't. They decide, not you. That's a harder trick. So that means putting yourself out and saying, here's what we believe will happen. We can't prove it in advance, we can't guarantee it, but this is what we want to have happen and that we believe will happen. It's much easier to say, I'll build a factory, I will hire more people, et cetera, than I will have customers end up liking our offering more than those of competitors. The tricky thing about planning is that while you're planning,

00:03:59	chances are at least one competitor is figuring out how to win. When US air carriers were busily planning what routes to fly and da-da-da, there was this little company in Texas called Southwest that had a strategy for winning. And at first, that looked largely irrelevant because it was tiny. What Southwest Airlines was aiming for was an outcome. What they wanted to be is a substitute for Greyhound, a way more convenient way to get around at a price that wasn't extraordinarily much greater than a Greyhound bus.

00:04:47	Southwest said, everybody else is flying hub and spoke. They have hubs, and they fly hub and spoke. We're going to fly point to point so that we don't have aircraft waiting on the ground because you only make money when you're in the air. We're going to only fly 737s, one kind of aircraft, so that our gates are set up for those, our systems are set up for those, our training, our simulations are set up. We're not going to offer meals on the flights because we're going to specialize in short flights.

00:05:15	We're not going to book through travel agents. We're going to encourage people to book online because that's less expensive for everybody and more convenient. So their strategy ended up having a substantially lower cost than any of the major carriers so that they could offer substantially lower prices. Because it had a way of winning, it got bigger and then bigger and then bigger and then bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger until it flies the most passenger seat miles in America. The major carriers were not trying

00:05:51	to win against one another. They were all playing to play, as I say. They were playing to participate, maybe buy more planes, get more gates, maybe grow some, not having a theory of here's how we could be better than our competitors. And that was fine until somebody came along and said, here's a way to be better than everybody else for this segment. And so that segment then goes. It's gone [FAST-MOVING SOUND]. And the main playing to play players have to share a smaller pie that's left over after Southwest takes whatever share it wants.

00:06:33	[MUSIC PLAYING] If you're trying to escape this planning trap, this comfort trap of doing something that's comfortable but not good for you, how do you start? The most important thing to recognize is that strategy will have angst associated with it. It'll make you feel somewhat nervous because as a manager, chances are you've been taught you should do things that you can prove in advance. You can't prove in advance that your strategy will succeed. You can look at a plan and say, well, all of these things

00:07:12	are doable. Let's just do those because they're within our control. But they won't add up to much. In strategy, you have to say, if our theory is right about what we can do and how the market will react, this will position us in an excellent way. Just accept the fact that you can't be perfect on that, and you can't know for sure. And that is not being a bad manager. That is being a great leader because you're giving your organization the chance to do something great. The second thing I do is say, lay out

00:07:49	the logic of your strategy clearly. What would have to be true about ourselves, about the industry, about competition, about customers for this strategy to work? Why do you do that? It's because you can then watch the world unfold. And if something that you say is in the logic that would have to be true for this to work is not working out quite the way you hoped, it'll allow you to tweak your strategy. And strategy is a journey, what you want to have as a mechanism for tweaking it, honing it, and refining it so it gets better and better as you

00:08:26	go along. Another thing that helps with strategy is not letting it get overcomplicated. It's great if you can write your strategy on a single page. Here's where we're choosing to play. Here's how we're choosing to win. Here are the capabilities we need to have in place. Here are the management systems. And that's why it's going to achieve this goal, this aspiration that we have. Then you lay out the logic, what must be true for that all to work out the way we hope. Go do it, and watch and tweak as you go along.

00:09:05	That may feel somewhat more worry-making, angst-making than planning, but I would tell you that if you plan, that's a way to guarantee losing. If you do strategy, it gives you the best possible chance of winning.

Takeaways:
1. Strategy and planning are not the same thing. Strategy involves making integrative choices that position you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.
2. A great strategy must have a coherent theory, be doable, and be translatable into actions.
3. Planning does not require coherence, but it is comfortable because it involves the resources you can control.
4. Strategy requires putting yourself out and specifying an outcome that involves customers wanting your product or service enough that they will buy enough of it to make the profitability that you'd like to make.
5. You do not control the customers, which makes strategy a trickier task.

How:
1. Start by identifying the playing field you want to be on. Determine where you can win.
2. Develop a theory as to why this playing field is the right one for you to be on.
3. Determine how you will win on this playing field. What can you do to serve the customers on this playing field better than anyone else?
4. Translate your theory and choices into concrete actions.

Imagine:
Think of strategy as a map. The map has to show you where you are and where you want to go. It should also show you the terrain and the obstacles you may encounter along the way. Without a map, you'll be lost, and without a strategy, you'll be directionless.

Why:

1. Strategy involves making integrative choices that position you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.
2. A great strategy must have a coherent theory, be doable, and be translatable into actions.
3. Planning is comfortable because it involves the resources you can control.
4. Strategy requires putting yourself out and specifying an outcome that involves customers wanting your product or service enough that they will buy enough of it to make the profitability that you'd like to make.
5. You do not control the customers, which makes strategy a trickier task.

Perspective:

1. Instead of focusing on the activities you want to engage in, focus on the outcomes you want to achieve.
2. Instead of listing a set of activities that sound good, identify a set of choices that will make you win on the playing field you choose.
3. Instead of trying to control the customers, focus on serving them better than anyone else.


What:
1. Focus on a specific market segment and differentiate from competitors.
2. Keep the business model simple and streamlined.
3. Use a clear and concise strategy that is easy to communicate and understand.
4. Accept uncertainty and take calculated risks.
5. Continuously monitor and adjust the strategy based on the changing environment.

How:
1. Fly point-to-point instead of hub-and-spoke.
2. Use only one type of aircraft to simplify operations.
3. Avoid offering meals on short flights to reduce costs.
4. Encourage customers to book online to save money.
5. Avoid booking through travel agents to reduce costs.

imagine:
Southwest Airlines chose to navigate through a less crowded and less risky path in the airline industry. They chose to fly point-to-point instead of the hub-and-spoke model used by major carriers, which is comparable to taking a direct flight instead of making multiple stops. They also focused on using only one type of aircraft, which is like having a specialized tool for a specific task. By keeping their business model simple and streamlined, they were able to reduce costs and offer lower prices to customers.

Case:
To apply these principles and tactics to your own situation, you need to first identify your target market and differentiate yourself from your competitors. 
Simplify your business model and focus on one or two key strengths that set you apart. 
Use a clear and concise strategy that is easy to communicate and understand. 
Take calculated risks and accept uncertainty, and continuously monitor and adjust your strategy based on the changing environment.

Why:
1. Flying point-to-point reduces aircraft waiting time and increases efficiency.
2. Using only one type of aircraft simplifies operations and reduces maintenance costs.
3. Avoiding offering meals on short flights reduces costs and increases efficiency.
4. Encouraging customers to book online reduces costs and increases convenience.
5. Avoiding booking through travel agents reduces costs and allows for direct communication with customers. 

Perspective:
1. Southwest's success is a result of taking a different approach to the airline industry and offering a unique value proposition to customers.
2. Southwest's business model is an example of the importance of simplicity and efficiency in achieving success.
3. Southwest's success can be attributed to their ability to continuously monitor and adjust their strategy based on the changing environment.
