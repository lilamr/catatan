Let’s walk through setting up a basic Django project step-by-step in a way that anyone, even with no technical background, can understand.

### Introduction

**Django** is a popular tool used to build websites. Think of it like a set of building blocks that help you create a website quickly and efficiently. In this guide, we'll go through the process of setting up a simple Django project and show you how to make a basic webpage.

### 1. Setting Up Your Project Environment

First, we need to create a space on your computer where we’ll build our project. This space is called a "virtual environment" and it keeps our project’s tools separate from other projects. 

1. **Create a New Folder:**
   - This is like creating a new folder in your file cabinet for our project.
   ```bash
   $ mkdir hellodjango
   ```

2. **Go into the Folder:**
   - This is like opening the folder you just created.
   ```bash
   $ cd hellodjango
   ```

3. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
   - This creates a special space where we can install the tools we need without affecting other projects on your computer.
   ```bash
   $ virtualenv .venv
   ```

4. **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
   - This is like turning on the special space we just created.
   ```bash
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install Django:**
   - Now, we’ll install Django, which is the tool we’ll use to build our website.
   ```bash
   $ pip install django
   ```

### 2. Creating a New Django Project

6. **Start a New Django Project:**
   - This sets up the basic structure for our website project.
   ```bash
   $ django-admin startproject hellodjango
   ```

7. **Apply Initial Database Setup:**
   - Django needs a database to store information. This command sets it up for us.
   ```bash
   $ python manage.py migrate
   ```

8. **Create an Admin User:**
   - This creates a special user account so you can manage your website through a web interface.
   ```bash
   $ python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

### 3. Creating a Web Page

9. **Start an App:**
   - Think of an "app" as a specific part of your website. For example, a blog or a store. We’ll create an app called "homepage" for our main page.
   ```bash
   $ python manage.py startapp homepage
   ```

10. **Create a Templates Folder:**
    - This folder will hold the files that define what our webpage looks like.
    ```bash
    $ mkdir templates
    ```

11. **Create an HTML File:**
    - We’ll create a simple webpage with a greeting. Save this as `index.html` inside the `templates` folder.
    ```html
    <h1>Greetings</h1>
    <p>Hello, world!</p>
    <p>{{ my_statement }}</p>
    <p>{{ view.say_bye }}</p>
    ```

### 4. Connecting Everything

12. **Update Project Settings:**
    - Tell Django where to find our HTML files. Open `hellodjango/settings.py` and find the `TEMPLATES` section. Add the following line:
    ```python
    'DIRS': [BASE_DIR / "templates", ],
    ```

13. **Define the View:**
    - This is the part where we tell Django what to show on our webpage. Open `homepage/views.py` and replace its contents with:
    ```python
    from django.views.generic import TemplateView

    class HomepageView(TemplateView):
        template_name = 'index.html'

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs)
            context['my_statement'] = 'Nice to see you!'
            return context

        def say_bye(self):
            return 'Goodbye'
    ```

14. **Set Up URL Routing:**
    - This is like setting up the address for our webpage. Open `hellodjango/urls.py` and add the following code:
    ```python
    from homepage.views import HomepageView
    
    path('', HomepageView.as_view(), name='home'),
    ```

### 5. Running Your Website

15. **Start the Django Server:**
    - Finally, we’ll start a local server so you can see your website in action.
    ```bash
    $ python manage.py runserver
    ```

16. **View Your Website:**
    - Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see your new website!

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just set up a basic Django project and created a simple webpage. You've learned how to prepare your environment, create a project, define what your webpage looks like, and view it in a browser. This is just the beginning, and there’s so much more you can do with Django. Happy coding!
