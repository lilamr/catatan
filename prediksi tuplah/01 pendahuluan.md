## Latar belakang

Land cover change causes land degradation, climate change, and the destruction of biodiversity and ecosystem services. 
Land cover change is caused by the high demand for land for plantations,
agriculture, timber companies for economic development activities, and forest fire.
Land cover is dynamic, requiring continuous assessment, analysis, and monitoring using environmental and anthropogenic variables to obtain integrated and accurate results.
It is important to identify land cover changes and their projected changes to achieve sustainable forest managemen.
The early detection of land cover changes and projection of land cover is mandatory to inform future forest management.
This constraint is a very important thing to discuss because by knowing future events, we can develop a risk mitigation plan.
Currently, modeling algorithms can understand past, present, and future land cover.
The Modules for Land Use Change Simulation (MOLUSCE) plugin in Quantum GIS provides several algorithms for future land cover prediction and change probability matrices.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Cellular Automata (CA) algorithms are the two popular algorithms for land cover prediction and simulation.
Implementing MOLUSCE with a combination of ANN and CA algorithms is appropriate for analyzing past, current, and future land cover conditions with environmental and anthropogenic variables as inputs.
This study can thus provide important information on land cover dynamics and future land cover projections as basic information for developing sustainable forest management plans. This study aims to model land cover change in 2000 and 2010, predict land cover in 2020, and simulate land cover in 2030 in NTB Province. // Jika menggunakan tuplah kementerian LHK: 2006, 2014, 2022 >> 2030.
