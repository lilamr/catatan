“procedural abstraction. We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)

“Programming is the process of taking an algorithm and encoding it into a notation, a programming language, so that it can be executed by a computer.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“the important first step is the need to have the solution. Without an algorithm there can be no program.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“Algorithms describe the solution to a problem in terms of the data needed to represent the problem instance and the set of steps necessary to produce the intended result.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“Programming languages must provide a notational way to represent both the process and the data. To this end, languages provide control constructs and data types.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 5)
“At a minimum, algorithms require constructs that perform sequential processing, selection for decision-making, and iteration for repetitive control. As long as the language provides these basic statements, it can be used for algorithm representation.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
- Sequence: Steps are executed in order, one after another.  
- Selection (Decision-making, e.g., if-else): Allows the algorithm to choose between different actions based on conditions.  
- Iteration (Loops, e.g., for, while): Repeats a set of steps multiple times until a condition is met.

“All data items in the computer are represented as strings of binary digits. In order to give these strings meaning, we need to have data types.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
“Data types provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
“a data type also provides a description of the operations that the data items can participate in.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
“These simple, language-provided constructs and data types, although certainly sufficient to represent complex solutions, are typically at a disadvantage as we work through the problem-solving process.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 6)
