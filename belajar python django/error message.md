“Every error message will usually contain: 
1. The error message: what actually went wrong. These can vary from a few cryptic words to a full paragraph containing suggestions on what you might be able to do to fix the bug. 
2. The location where the error occurred: the file, line number, and sometimes the function name where your program was when it crashed.
3. The stack trace: all the lines in your code that the program executed until getting to the function in number 2. This can help trace where your function was called and with which parameters.” (Lyman, p. 66)
