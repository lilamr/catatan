Logic models (or knowledge bases) provide a formal specification for organizing and interpreting information. Represents a problem in terms of propositions about topics of interest and their logical interrelations. a topic for analysis is translated into a testable proposition. For example, if the topic is forest sustainability, the associated proposition might be as simple as ‘The forest ecosystem is sustainable.’ The statement of the proposition by itself is inherently ambiguous because sustainability is an abstract concept. However, the full formal logic specification underlying a proposition makes the semantic content of the proposition clear and precise.

The biophysical, socioeconomic and framework topics are logical premises of forest sustainability. The proposition about forest ecosystem sustainability evaluates as true to the degree that integrity of the biophysical environment, suitable socioeconomic conditions, and a suitable framework exist.

The phrase, ‘true to the degree that,’ in the previous sentence is intended to emphasize that strength of support for propositions is evaluated by what might be termed ‘evidence-based reasoning.’ 

The logical discourse on forest ecosystem sustainability is extended by providing a logic specification for each premise. Each iteration of discourse extends the logic structure another level deeper by defining a logic specification for each topic in the level above. The pattern of discourse generally proceeds from abstract to concrete propositions, with a tendency for premises of a particular proposition to be less abstract than that proposition. Eventually, each logic pathway terminates in a premise, or set of premises, each of which can be evaluated by reference to data. Logic pathways in a knowledge base can thus be construed as a cognitive map of the problem that provides a formal data specification. The specification not only describes what data are to be evaluated, but how the data are to be interpreted to arrive at conclusions.

Fig. 2. Partial logic specification for evaluating sustainability of a forest ecosystem. Each premise has its own logic specification that may extend many more levels. NetWeaver knowledge bases are graphically built from modular components like this, simplifying incremental development of complex models. Only the first three levels of network structure are illustrated.

Fig. 5. Additional level of detail of the logic specification for the biodiversity criterion, illustrating the AND and SUM operators which represent different philosophies about how information combines.

all indicators (or more specific endpoints) of criterion are evaluated by mapping values from a subjective ordinal response scale (none, weak, moderate, strong evidence) for each nominal measurement endpoint. We consider these qualitative specifications for evaluations to be temporary placeholders for more quantitative ones that hopefully will be forthcoming as appropriate technical authorities develop suitable measurement endpoints.

Evaluating sustainability and defining desired future conditions are fundamentally different actions. Comparing indicator values to reference conditions (evaluating sustainability) enables us to understand where we are at and where we are headed—to assess the risks to sustaining the values in which we are interested. Defining desired future conditions (setting ‘targets’), on the other hand, states where we would like to go. While evaluating sustainability can inform our thinking on what we would like to achieve, reference conditions and desired future conditions need to be kept separate so that people do not mix what ‘is’ with what we would like to be.
