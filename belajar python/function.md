“In general, we can hide the details of any computation by defining a function. A function definition requires a name, a group of parameters, and a body. It may also explicitly return a value.” (Miller and Ranum, p. 28)
“The details, hidden “inside the box,” simply compute the result” (Miller and Ranum, p. 28)

“Function is another word for method. It’s just a piece of code that does something and (usually) has a name.” (Lyman, p. 33)
“giveMeOne() is kind of like dumb_tweets.push(). The main differences are: 1. giveMeOne() is a function we wrote by ourselves. push() is a function that some strangers wrote. It’s okay, they don’t mind if we use it. 2. push() is a method of dumb_tweets (and any other array we’ll ever create). giveMeOne() is global, meaning that we don’t need to refer to a specific object in order to use it.” (Lyman, p. 34)

“You’ll notice one more thing that seems different about them: giveMeOne() uses empty parentheses, but push() expects us to put a piece of data in the parentheses. In fact, push() would be useless if we couldn’t tell it what to add to our array. The piece of data we give it is called an argument. An argument is just a piece of data that we drop into a function.” (Lyman, p. 34)

“This function isn’t too different from giveMeOne(). But instead of empty parentheses, these have variable names in them, separated by a comma. These are our arguments. The return statement does exactly what it looks like it’s doing: it adds number1 and number2 together, then pops out the result.” (Lyman, p. 34)

“This function does exactly the same thing. It just uses a variable named sum as a middleman, where the result is stored so we can return it later.” (Lyman, p. 35)
“There are many ways to write a function. You should choose the way that most clearly expresses what the code is doing. Code that is concise and easy to understand is often called expressive or elegant.” (Lyman, p. 35)

“Functions are very selfish. If you declare a variable inside of a function, the function won’t let any of the code outside of itself use the variable.” (Lyman, p. 38)
